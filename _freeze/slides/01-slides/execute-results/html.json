Understand the special problems that cultural research presents for **measurement.**\n2.  Understand the deeper, and prior concept of **confounding.**\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1.  Measurement\n2.  Validity \n3.  A confounder \n\n\n## Where Does Psychology Start?\n\nPsychology starts with a question about how people think or behave.\n\n## Examples of Psychological Questions?\n\n-   How does early childhood experience affect personality and behaviour?\n\n-   What are the effects of social media on self-esteem?\n\n-   Why do some people believe in a God or gods and others do not?\n\n-   Why are some people motivated to sacrifice for others?\n\n-   Does marriage make people happy?\n\n## Example of Psychological Questions in Cross-Cultural Psychology\n\n-   How do early childhood experiences differ across cultures, and how do these differences impact personality and behavior development?\n\n-   Are there cultural differences in the way social media use affects self-esteem and body image?\n\n-   How do cultural and religious beliefs shape individual attitudes towards the concept of God or gods?\n\n-   What are the cultural and individual factors that motivate people to engage in acts of altruism or sacrifice for others, and how do these factors vary across cultures?\n\n-   Are there cultural differences in the factors that contribute to marital satisfaction and happiness, and how do cultural expectations and values surrounding marriage play a role?\n\n## How might Psychological Scientists answer whether marriage makes people happy?\n\n## *Wrong* Answers Only\n\n-   \"Ask my married parents if they are happy.\"\n\n-   \"Consult a palm reader.\"\n\n-   Assert: \"Yes marriage always makes people happy\"; \"No marriage can't possibly make anyone happy\"\n\n-   Intuit: \"It depends on the gender of the individual. Men are always happier in marriage, while women are never happier.\"\n\n-   Intuition: \"It depends on the cultural background of the individuals. Couples from Western cultures are always happier in marriage, while couples from Eastern cultures are never happier.\"\n\n-   Conduct a literature review of previous research on the association between marriage and happiness, including cross-cultural studies that compare different cultural attitudes and practices regarding marriage and their relationship to happiness.\n\n-   Conduct a survey of a large and diverse sample of individuals to assess their happiness levels, as well as their marital status assess the relationship.\n\n## Conduct a Literature Review {.incremental}\n\n-   What would this tell us?\n\n    -   what other researchers have found.\n\n-   What would this not tell us?\n\n    -   what other researchers have not found.\n    -   what other researchers got wrong.\n\n## Conduct a Survey with a Large and Diverse Sample of Individuals\n\n-   Where to begin?\n\n## Measurement\n\nDefinitions:\n\n-   \"Measurement is the numerical quantifcation of the attributes of an object or event, which can be used to compare with other objects or events\" \\[Conventional\\]\n-   \"Measurement is the assignment of numerals to objects or events according to rules.\" \\[Psychological\\]\n-   \"Measurement is the process of experimentally obtaining one or more quantity values that can reasonably be attributed to a quantity.\" \\[Metrological\\] from [@briggs2021]\n\n## \"On a scale of 1-7, how happy are you?\"\n\nHow might this go wrong?\n\n-   Ambiguity: Respondents may interpret \"happiness\" in different ways. -e.g. Some people may equate happiness with a momentary positive emotion -e.g. Others may think of happiness as a long-term state of contentment.\n-   Social Desirability Bias: Respondents may want to tell you what they think you want to hear. Others might want to frustrate you.\n-   Mood: the context in which the question is asked and the respondent's current mood might affect the answer (reliability)\n-   Limited range of scale\n-   What do the endpoints mean?\n-   Cultural Differences:\n    -   in meanings\n    -   in constructs themselves\n    \n## In Survey Research\n\nConstruct: e.g. Happiness - a subjective experience of positive emotions, such as joy, contentment, and satisfaction with life/\n\n**Item**: A question or statement used to measure an aspect of happiness. Example: \"I feel content with my life.\"\n\n**Scale**: A collection of items designed to measure a construct. Example: a happiness scale might consist of items rated on a Likert-type scale, with an overall score reflecting the level of happiness being measured. Example: \n\n- \"In general, how happy do you feel?\" (rated on a scale from 1 - not at all happy to 5 - extremely happy)\n- \"How often do you feel positive emotions, such as joy or contentment?\" (rated on a scale from 1 - very rarely or never to 5 - very often or always)\n- \"How satisfied are you with your life as a whole?\" (rated on a scale from 1 - very dissatisfied to 5 - very satisfied)\n    \n\n## Concept of `Validity` in Psychometric Research\n\n-   Content Validity: The degree an instrument measures what it is intended to measure (the \"construct\").\n-   Construct Validity: Whether the construct assumed to measure is accurately defined and operationalised.\n-   Criterion Validity: Whether an instrument accurately predicts performance.\n-   Face Validity: whether an instrument measure what it is intended to measure, as assessed by experts.\n-   Ecological Validity: whether an instrument accurately reflects real-world situations and behavior [@bandalos2018]\n\n\n:::{.notes}\nMetric equivalence: Factor loadings are similar across groups.\nConfigural equivalence: The factor structure is the same across groups in a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis.\nScalar equivalence: Values/Means are also equivalent across groups.\n:::\n\n## What else might go wrong?\n\nSuppose we are confident in measurement, administer survey, and find an relationship.\n\n::: {.fragment .highlight-red}\nDoes marriage cause happiness cross culturally?\n:::\n\n\n## What might go wrong?\n\n\n### Happiness might *cause* marriage\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-slides_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## What else might go wrong?\n\n\n### Age might a common cause of both marriage and happiness\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-slides_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Many psychologists will simply \"control for\" income, but what if happiness and marriage cause income? \n\n- Simulate data in which happiness and marriage cause income\n- Controlling for income makes it look as though happiness and marriage are **negatively** related.\n- But we simulated data with *no* relationship!\n- This is called 'collider bias', we will consider how it works in the upcoming weeks.\n- Meantime, even if we measure people without error, cross-cultural studies might select people with different incomes, leading to bias **even in the absence of measurement error bias** (and **even if we do not control for income!**)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## simulate data\n# reproducability\nset.seed(123)\nsim_fun_B <- function() {\n  n <- 10000\n  H <- rnorm(n, 1) # simulates Happiness,\n  M <- rnorm(n, 1) #  simulates Marriage, nothing to do with happiness\n  I <- rnorm(n, .2 * H + .5 * M) # simulate marriage as a function of age + happiness\n\n\n  # simulate dataframe from function\n  simdat_B <- data.frame(\n    H = H,\n    I = I,\n    M = M\n  )\n\n  #  model in which marriage \"predicts\" happiness controlling for age\n  sim_B <- lm(H ~ M + I, data = simdat_B)\n  sim_B # returns output\n}\n\n# replicate 100 times\nr_lm_B <- NA\nr_lm_B <- replicate(100, sim_fun_B(), simplify = FALSE)\n\n# print model results: marriage looks negatively related to happiness!\nparameters::pool_parameters(r_lm_B)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# Fixed Effects\n\nParameter   | Coefficient |   SE |         95% CI | Statistic |     df |      p\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept) |        0.96 | 0.02 | [ 0.92,  1.00] |     46.96 | 322.51 | < .001\nM           |       -0.10 | 0.02 | [-0.13, -0.07] |     -6.11 | 324.10 | < .001\nI           |        0.19 | 0.01 | [ 0.17,  0.22] |     13.71 | 320.53 | < .001\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## The problem is confounding: what can we do about it?\n\n- Weeks 2-4: Causal Diagrams\n\n## Our Approach: \n\n### External Validity\n\n- **Definition**: the extent to which the findings of a study can be generalised to other situations, people, settings, and time periods.\n\n- **Importance**: we want to know if our findings carry beyond the people in our study\n\n- **Challenges**: how can we know? \n\n### Internal Validity\n\n- **Definition**: the degree to which a study can demonstrate that a causal relationship exists between the 'independent' and 'dependent' variables, free of confounding.\n\n- We will use the term 'outcome' and 'treatment' in place of independent and dependent.  This is because causality occurs in **time**.\n\n- **Importance**: we cannot interpret the associations we recover if they do not have a causal interpretation.\n\n- **Challenges**: internal validity requires balance in the confounders that might afffect the treatement and outcome, and observational data do not give us ballance.\n\n- **The Special Challenges in Cross-Cultural Research**:\n  - The concept of *measurement* itself has **causal** underpinnings [@vanderweele2022].\n  - In cross-cultural research, we have stronger challengs from *measurement* validity, which, as we shall see, encompasses both external and internal validity.\n  - We consider measurment validity within classical framework of external and internal validity\n  - Ethical challenges, which science needs to consider.\n  - Foremost among these ethical challenges, I believe, is doing our best to get inference right!\n\n\n## The Hope\n\n- There has been tremendous progress in the health and computer sciences in addressing problems of external and internal validity from a causal perspective\n- You will be among the first to apply these methods to questions in cross-cultural psychology. \n- In doing so, much of what has been confusing to you about psychological research design, data-analysis, ultimately scientific inference will be clearer.\n\n\n\n## What have we learned? \n\n::: {.fragment .highlight-red}\n\n1.  Measurement: attaching magnitudes to features of the world.\n2.  Validity: obtaining *accurate* scientific inference: a complex set of interrelated problems.\n3.
