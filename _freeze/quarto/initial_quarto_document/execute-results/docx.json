Estimate the causal effect of YOUR EXPOSURE on YOUR OUTCOMES measured one year later.\n    2. Evaluate whether these effects vary across the population.\n    3. Provide policy guidance on which individuals might benefit most.\n  \n  **Method**: We conducted a three-wave retrospective cohort study (waves XX-XXX, October XXXX--October XXXX) using data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, a nationally representative panel. Participants were eligible if they participated in the NZAVS in the baseline wave (XXXX, were under the age of 62, and were employed > 20 hours per week. We defined the exposure as (XXXX  > NUMBER on a 1-7 Likert Scale (1 = yes, 0 = no)). To address attrition, we applied inverse probability of censoring weights; to improve external validity, we applied weighted to the population distribution of Age, Ethnicity, and Gender. We computed expected mean outcomes for the population in each exposure condition (high XXXX/low XXXXX). Under standard causal assumptions of unconfoundedness, the contrast provides an unbiased average treatment effect. We then used causal forests to detect heterogeneity in these effects and employed policy tree algorithms to identify individuals (\"strong responders\") likely to experience the greatest benefits.\n  \n  **Results**:   Increasing XXXXX leads to XXXXX. Heterogeneous responses to (e.g. *Forgiveness*, *Personal Well-Being*, and *Life-Satisfaction*...) reveal structural variability in subpopulations...\n  \n  **Implications**: (Brief few sentences)\n  **Keywords**: *Causal Inference*;  *Cross-validation*; *Distress*; *Employment*; *Longitudinal*; *Machine sLearning*; *Religion*; *Semi-parametric*; *Targeted Learning*.\nauthor: \n  - name: YOUR NAME\n    affiliation: Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand\n    email: XXXXX\n    corresponding: yes\nkeywords: [Causal Inference, Cross-validation,...]\neditor_options: \n  chunk_output_type: console\ndate: \"last-modified\"\nfontfamily: libertinus\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: apa7.csl\nformat:\n  docx: \n    default: false\n  pdf:\n    pdf-engine: lualatex\n    sanitise: true\n    keep-tex: true\n    link-citations: true\n    colorlinks: true\n    documentclass: article\n    classoption: [\"single column\"]\n    lof: false\n    lot: false\n    geometry:\n      - top=30mm\n      - left=25mm\n      - heightrounded\n      - headsep=22pt\n      - headheight=11pt\n      - footskip=33pt\n      - ignorehead\n      - ignorefoot\n    header-includes:\n      - \\let\\oldtabular\\tabular\n      - \\renewcommand{\\tabular}{\\small\\oldtabular}\n      - \\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{4pt}  # adjust this value as needed\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n  include: true\n  eval: true\n---\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n## Method\n\n### Sample\n\nData were collected as part of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS), an annual longitudinal national probability panel assessing New Zealand residents’ social attitudes, personality, ideology, and health outcomes. The panel began in 2009 and has since expanded to include over fifty researchers, with responses from 40,000 participants to date. The study operates independently of political or corporate funding and is based at a university. It employs prize draws to incentivise participation. The NZAVS tends to slightly under-sample males and individuals of Asian descent and to over-sample females and Māori (the Indigenous people of New Zealand). To enhance the representativeness of our sample population estimates for the target population of New Zealand, we apply census-based survey weights that adjust for age, gender, and ethnicity (New Zealand European, Asian, Māori, Pacific) [@sibley2021]. For more information about the NZAVS, visit: [OSF.IO/75SNB](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/75SNB). Refer to [Appendix A](#appendix-timeline) for a histogram of daily responses for this cohort.\n\n### Target Population\n\nThe target population for this study comprises New Zealand residents as represented in the NZAVS time 10, years 2018-2019 of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) during the years NZAVS time 10, years 2018-2019 weighted by New Zealand Census weights for age, gender, and ethnicity (refer to @sibley2021). The NZAVS is a national probability study designed to reflect the broader New Zealand population accurately. Despite its comprehensive scope, the NZAVS has some limitations in its demographic representation. Notably, it tends to under-sample males and individuals of Asian descent while over-sampling females and Māori (the indigenous peoples of New Zealand). To address these disparities and enhance the accuracy of our findings, we apply New Zealand Census survey weights to the sample data.\n\n### Eligibility Criteria\n\nTo be included in the analysis of this study, participants needed to participate in the NZAVS time 10, years 2018-2019 of the study and respond to the baseline measure of Extraversion.\n\nParticipants may have been lost to follow-up at the end of the study if they met eligibility criteria at NZAVS time 10, years 2018-2019. We adjusted for attrition and non-response using censoring weights, described below.\n\nA total of 39,635 individuals met these criteria and were included in the study.\n\n### Average Treatment Effect\n\nResearchers often want to know what might happen if we could change (or “intervene on”) a particular variable for everyone in a study—much like testing a new treatment in a randomised trial. Because we cannot always run an actual trial, we imagine a **target trial** [@hernan2016], a hypothetical experiment that clarifies exactly which cause-and-effect question we are trying to answer.\n\nHere, we ask:\n\n  > “How would the outcomes of interest change if, for everyone in the population, we set the exposure to **>4, scale range 1-7**, compared with setting it to **<=4, scale range 1-7**, given each individual’s characteristics?”\n\nThus we compare two scenarios:\n\n1. **4**: Everyone receives exposure level `>4, scale range 1-7`.\n2. **1**: Everyone receives exposure level `<=4, scale range 1-7`.\n\nThe difference between the averages of these two scenarios is call the 'Average Treatment Effect' (ATE). By combining time series data with a rich set of covariates measured at baseline, we may, under the assumptions of no-measured confounding and other assumptions described below, isolate the effect of the intervening on the exposure from other variables that might distort the true causal relationship if not properly accounted for. By measuring a broad set of characteristics (such as demographics, personality traits, or other background factors) at baseline, we try to ensure that, once we adjust for them in our analysis, assignment to each of the exposure conditions is 'as good as random.' (Refer to Appendix [F](#appendix-assumptions_grf) for an explanation of assumptions for obtaining the ATE).\n\n\n### Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and Treatment Policies\n\nAfter estimating the overall average treatment effect (ATE) for the population, we turn to the question of whether different people respond differently. We investigate effect modifiers (or moderators)—factors that make the intervention more or less effective for certain subgroups—by estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) using a causal forest approach. While the ATE reflects the overall impact, the CATE reveals how that impact can vary across individuals with different baseline characteristics. We denote the individual-level estimated treatment effect as $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$, which represents the predicted benefit for an individual with covariates $x$. A notable advantage of causal forests is that we do not have to specify potential moderators in advance; the algorithm uncovers them automatically. We can also apply search algorithms to derive priority treatment rules that target the intervention to those most likely to benefit.\n\nFirst, we standardised effect directions by inverting outcomes where lower scores were preferable so that positive values always indicated improvement. Specifically, we inverted Anxiety, Depression, Rumination.\n\nNext, to reduce overfitting and distinguish true heterogeneity from noise, we split the sample. We trained the causal forest on the first half and tested its predictions exclusively on the second half. In the held-out data, we checked calibration by comparing the mean of the predicted CATEs, $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$, with the overall ATE. We also performed a differential prediction test [@grf2024] to assess whether the predicted variation was genuine. As an additional check for heterogeneity, we computed the Rank-Weighted Average Treatment Effect (RATE), which quantifies the benefit of targeting individuals predicted to benefit most [@grf2024; @wager2018].\n\nHaving assessed preliminary evidence of heterogeneity using differential prediction and RATE estimation, we used Qini curves [@grf2024] to illustrate how a targeted strategy might outperform a uniform one. Specifically, we compared:\n\n1. **Uniform Allocation:** treating (or not treating) everyone based on the ATE;\n2. **Targeted Allocation:** treating those with the highest predicted CATEs ($\\hat{\\tau}(x)$) first.\n\nA positive Qini value suggests that a targeted strategy can achieve better outcomes. Here, we considered whether budgets limited to 20% or 50% of the population could yield greater improvements under targeted allocation than under the uniform approach.\n\nFinally, when we found signs of genuine heterogeneity (via either RATE or Qini curves), we used policy trees [@policytree_package_2024; @athey2021; @athey_2021_policy_tree_econometrica] to generate simple, rule-based treatment recommendations (e.g., “Treat if baseline score > X”). We implemented all heterogeneity analyses—calibration tests, RATE, Qini curves, and policy trees—in R using the grf [@grf2024], policytree [@policytree_package_2024], and margot [@margot2024] packages. This approach enabled us to identify individualised effects, confirm their robustness, estimate the potential value of targeting, and propose straightforward strategies for personalisation. (Refer to [Appendix D](#appendix-explain-grf) for a detailed explanation of our approach.)\n\n### Exposure Indicator\n\n\nThe New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study assesses Extraversion using the following question:\n\n\nMini-IPIP6 Extraversion dimension: (i) I am the life of the party. (ii) I don't talk a lot. (r) (iii) I keep in the background. (r) (iv) I talk to a lot of different people at parties.(Refer to [Appendix A](#appendix-measures)).\n\n### Causal Identification Assumptions\n\nThis study relies on the following identification assumptions for estimating the causal effect of Extraversion:\n\n1. **Consistency**: the observed outcome under the observed Extraversion is equal to the potential outcome under that exposure level. As part of consistency, we assume no interference: the potential outcomes for one individual are not affected by the Extraversion status of other individuals.\n\n2. **No unmeasured confounding**: all variables that affect both Extraversion and the outcome have been measured and accounted for in the analysis.\n\n3. **Positivity**: there is a non-zero probability of receiving each level of Extraversion for every combination of values of Extraversion and confounders in the population. Positivity is the only fundamental casual assumption that can be evaluated with data (refer to [Appendix E](#appendix-positivity)).\n\n### Confounding Control\n\nTo manage confounding in our analysis, we implement @vanderweele2019's *modified disjunctive cause criterion* by following these steps:\n\n1. **Identified all common causes** of both the treatment and outcomes.\n2. **Excluded instrumental variables** that affect the exposure but not the outcome. Instrumental variables do not contribute to controlling confounding and can reduce the efficiency of the estimates.\n3. **Included proxies for unmeasured confounders** affecting both exposure and outcome. According to the principles of d-separation @pearl2009a, using proxies allows us to control for their associated unmeasured confounders indirectly.\n4. **Controlled for baseline exposure** and **baseline outcome**. Both are used as proxies for unmeasured common causes, enhancing the robustness of our causal estimates, refer to @vanderweele2020.\n\n### Statistical Estimation\n\nWe estimate heterogeneous treatment effects with Generalized Random Forests (GRF) [@grf2024]. GRF extends random forests for causal inference by focusing on conditional average treatment effects (CATE). It handles complex interactions and non-linearities without explicit model specification, and it provides 'honest' estimates by splitting data between model-fitting and inference. GRF is doubly robust because it remains consistent if either the outcome model or the propensity model is correct. We evaluate policies with the `policytree` package [@policytree_package_2024; @athey_2021_policy_tree_econometrica] and visualise results with `margot` [@margot2024]. (Refer to [Appendix D](#appendix-explain-grf) for a detailed explanation of our approach.)\n\n### Missing Data\n\nThe GRF package accepts missing values at baseline. To obtain valid inference for missing responses we computed inverse probability of censoring weights for censoring of the exposure, given that systematic censoring following the baseline wave may lead to selection bias that limit generalistion to the baseline target population [@bulbulia2024wierd]. See [Appendix D](#appendix-explain-grf).\n\n### Sensitivity Analysis\n\nWe perform sensitivity analyses using the E-value metric [@vanderweele2017; @linden2020EVALUE]. The E-value represents the minimum association strength (on the risk ratio scale) that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and outcome—after adjusting for measured covariates—to explain away the observed exposure-outcome association [@vanderweele2020; @linden2020EVALUE].\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n## Results\n\n### Average Treatement Effects\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Average Treatment Effects on Multi-dimensional Wellbeing](initial_quarto_document_files/figure-docx/fig-ate-1.png){#fig-ate}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n::: {#tbl-outcomes .cell tbl-cap='Average Treatment Effects on Multi-dimensional Wellbeing'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Outcome                       |ATE        |2.5 %      |97.5 %     |E-Value   |E-Value bound |\n|:-----------------------------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:---------|:-------------|\n|**Social Belonging**          |**0.125**  |**0.083**  |**0.167**  |**1.488** |**1.372**     |\n|**Neighbourhood Community**   |**0.119**  |**0.073**  |**0.165**  |**1.471** |**1.343**     |\n|**Social Support**            |**0.096**  |**0.052**  |**0.14**   |**1.407** |**1.277**     |\n|**Self Esteem**               |**0.087**  |**0.047**  |**0.127**  |**1.381** |**1.26**      |\n|**Meaning: Purpose**          |**0.095**  |**0.043**  |**0.147**  |**1.404** |**1.241**     |\n|**Meaning: Sense**            |**0.086**  |**0.033**  |**0.138**  |**1.378** |**1.208**     |\n|**Anxiety**                   |**-0.064** |**-0.107** |**-0.02**  |**1.312** |**1.159**     |\n|**Depression**                |**-0.057** |**-0.103** |**-0.011** |**1.29**  |**1.116**     |\n|**Personal Well-being Index** |**0.052**  |**0.011**  |**0.094**  |**1.274** |**1.11**      |\n|Rumination                    |-0.04      |-0.091     |0.01       |1.233     |1             |\n|Hours of Exercise (log)       |-0.032     |-0.088     |0.024      |1.204     |1             |\n|Life Satisfaction             |0.044      |0          |0.088      |1.247     |1             |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nConfidence intervals were adjusted for multiple comparisons using bonferroni correction ($\\alpha$ = 0.05).

service attendance, during the baseline and exposure waves. This variable was not measured in part of NZAVS time 12 (years 2020-2021) and part of NZAVS time 13 (years 2021-2022). To address missingness, if a value was observed after NZAVS time 14, we carried the previous observation forward and created and NA indicator. If there was no future observation, the participant was treated as censored, and inverse probability of censoring weights were applied, following our standard method for handling missing observations (see mansucript **Method**/**Handling of Missing Data**). Here, our carry-forward imputation approach may result in conservative causal effect estimation because it introduces measurement error. However, this approach would not generally bias causal effect estimation away from the null because the measurement error is unsystematic and random and unrelated to the outcomes. -->\n\n\n:::

transition matrices capture shifts in states between consecutive waves. Each cell shows the count of individuals transitioning from one state to another. Rows are the initial state (From), columns the subsequent state (To). **Diagonal entries** (in **bold**) mark those who stayed in the same state.\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n## Appendix D: Evidence of Heterogeneity {#appendix-cate-validation}\n\n\n#### Rate Test\n\nThe RATE tells us how much better we could do by offering treatment first to those who are predicted to benefit most, rather than treating everyone the same. A higher RATE suggests that targeting people according to their CATE indicators can lead to 'better' overall results (where ‘higher’ always means better, recall we flipped Anxiety, Depression, Rumination).\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-rate-autoc .cell}\n### Evidence for heterogeneous treatment effects (policy = treat best responders) using AUTOC\n\nAUTOC uses logarithmic weighting to focus treatment on top responders.\n\nPositive RATE estimates for: **Hours of Exercise (log)**.\n\nEstimates (**Hours of Exercise (log)**: 0.065 (95% CI 0.018, 0.112)) show robust heterogeneity.\n\nFor outcomes with 95% CI crossing zero (Meaning: Sense, Rumination, Anxiety, Personal Well-being Index, Self Esteem, Social Belonging, Social Support, Life Satisfaction, Meaning: Purpose, Depression, Neighbourhood Community), evidence is inconclusive.\n:::\n\n\n### Evidence for heterogeneous treatment effects (policy = treat best responders) using QINI\n\nQINI uses linear weighting to balance effect size and prevalence.\n\nPositive RATE estimates for: **Meaning: Sense**.\n\nEstimates (**Meaning: Sense**: 0.020 (95% CI 0.002, 0.038)) show robust heterogeneity.\n\nNegative RATE estimates for: **Neighbourhood Community**.\n\nEstimates (**Neighbourhood Community**: -0.026 (95% CI -0.042, -0.010)) caution against CATE prioritisation.\n\nFor outcomes with 95% CI crossing zero (Hours of Exercise (log), Personal Well-being Index, Anxiety, Self Esteem, Social Support, Life Satisfaction, Social Belonging, Rumination, Meaning: Purpose, Depression), evidence is inconclusive.\n\n### Comparison of targeting operating characteristic (TOC) by rank average treatment effect (RATE): AUTOC vs QINI\n\nWe applied two TOC by RATE methods to the same causal-forest \\tau(x) estimates:\n\n- **AUTOC** intensifies focus on top responders via logarithmic weighting.\n\n- **QINI** balances effect size and prevalence via linear weighting.\n\nWhen QINI and AUTOC disagree on positive RATE (only AUTOC yields a positive RATE for **Hours of Exercise (log)**; only QINI yields a positive RATE for Meaning: Sense), choose **QINI** to maximise overall benefit or **AUTOC** to focus on top responders.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![RATE AUTOC Graphs](initial_quarto_document_files/figure-docx/fig-qini-1.png){#fig-qini}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe computed the cumulative benefits as we increase the treated fraction by prioritising conditional average treatment effects (CATE) at two different spend levels: 20% of a total budget and 50% of a total budget, where the contrast is no priority assignment. \n **Neighbourhood Community**\nNo benefits for priority investments as measured by the QINI curve at the twenty and fifty percent spend levels.\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n## References {.appendix-refs}\n\n\n\n\n\n",
