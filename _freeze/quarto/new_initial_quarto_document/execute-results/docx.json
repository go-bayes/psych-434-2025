Estimate the causal effect of YOUR EXPOSURE on YOUR OUTCOMES measured one year later.\n    2. Evaluate whether these effects vary across the population.\n    3. Provide policy guidance on which individuals might benefit most.\n  **Method**: We conducted a three-wave retrospective cohort study (waves XX-XXX, October XXXX--October XXXX) using data *SIMULATED* from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, a nationally representative panel. Participants were eligible if they participated in the NZAVS in the baseline wave (XXXX,...). We defined the exposure as (XXXX  > NUMBER on a 1-7 Likert Scale (1 = yes, 0 = no)). To address attrition, we applied inverse probability of censoring weights; to improve external validity, we applied weights to the population distribution of Age, Ethnicity, and Gender. We computed expected mean outcomes for the population in each exposure condition (high XXXX/low XXXXX). Under standard causal assumptions of unconfoundedness, the contrast provides an unbiased average treatment effect. We then used causal forests to detect heterogeneity in these effects and employed policy tree algorithms to identify individuals (\"strong responders\") likely to experience the greatest benefits.\n  **Results**:   Increasing XXXXX leads to XXXXX. Heterogeneous responses to (e.g. *Forgiveness*, *Personal Well-Being*, and *Life-Satisfaction*...) reveal structural variability in subpopulations...\n  **Implications**: (Brief few sentences)\n  **Keywords**: *Causal Inference*;  *Cross-validation*; *Distress*; *Employment*; *Longitudinal*; *Machine Learning*; *Religion*; *Semi-parametric*; *Targeted Learning*.\nauthor: \n  - name: YOUR NAME\n    affiliation: Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand\n    email: XXXXX\n    corresponding: yes\nkeywords: [Causal Inference, Cross-validation,...]\neditor_options: \n  chunk_output_type: console\ndate: \"last-modified\"\nfontfamily: libertinus\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: apa7.csl\nformat:\n  docx: # comment this out if you want pdf\n    default: false  # comment this out if you want pdf\n  pdf:\n    pdf-engine: lualatex\n    sanitise: true\n    keep-tex: true\n    link-citations: true\n    colorlinks: true\n    documentclass: article\n    classoption: [\"single column\"]\n    lof: false\n    lot: false\n    geometry:\n      - top=30mm\n      - left=25mm\n      - heightrounded\n      - headsep=22pt\n      - headheight=11pt\n      - footskip=33pt\n      - ignorehead\n      - ignorefoot\n    header-includes:\n      - \\let\\oldtabular\\tabular\n      - \\renewcommand{\\tabular}{\\small\\oldtabular}\n      - \\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{4pt}  # adjust this value as needed\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n  include: true\n  eval: true\n---\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n## Introduction\n\n**Your place to shine here**\n\n## Method\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n## Results\n\n### Average Treatment Effects\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Average Treatment Effects on Multi-dimensional Wellbeing](new_initial_quarto_document_files/figure-docx/fig-ate-1.png){#fig-ate}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n::: {#tbl-outcomes .cell tbl-cap='Average Treatment Effects on Multi-dimensional Wellbeing'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Outcome                 |ATE    |2.5 %  |97.5 % |E-Value |E-Value bound |\n|:-----------------------|:------|:------|:------|:-------|:-------------|\n|Social Support          |-0.055 |-0.111 |0.001  |1.284   |1             |\n|Neighbourhood Community |-0.011 |-0.065 |0.043  |1.111   |1             |\n|Social Belonging        |-0.035 |-0.087 |0.017  |1.215   |1             |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nConfidence intervals were adjusted for multiple comparisons using bonferroni correction ($\\alpha$ = 0.05).
