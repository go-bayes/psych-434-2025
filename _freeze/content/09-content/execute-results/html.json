to move the confidence interval to include the null, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with the outcome and the exposure by a risk ratio of 1.12-fold (or 12%) each could do so, but weaker joint confounder associations could not.\n\nThe equations are as follows (for risk ratios)\n\n$$\nE-value_{RR} = RR + \\sqrt{RR \\times (RR - 1)}\n$$ $$\nE-value_{LCL} = LCL + \\sqrt{LCL \\times (LCL - 1)}\n$$\n\nHere is an R function that will calculate E-values\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# evalue for risk ratio\ncalculate_e_value <- function(rr, lcl) {\n  e_value_rr = rr + sqrt(rr*(rr - 1))\n  e_value_lcl = lcl + sqrt(lcl*(lcl - 1))\n  \n  list(e_value_rr = e_value_rr, e_value_lcl = e_value_lcl)\n}\n\n# e.g. smoking causes cancer\n# finding \tRR = 10.73 (95% CI: 8.02, 14.36)\nevalue_computed <- calculate_e_value(10.73, 8.02)\n\n#print\nevalue_computed\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$e_value_rr\n[1] 20.94777\n\n$e_value_lcl\n[1] 15.52336\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nWe write:\n\n> With an observed risk ratio of RR=10.7, an unmeasured confounder that was associated 20.9477737-fold each, above and beyond the measured confounders, could explain away the estimate, but weaker joint confounder associations could not;

Here's a function and LaTeX code to describe the approximation.\n\nThis function takes a linear regression coefficient estimate (`est`), its standard error (`se`), the standard deviation of the outcome (`sd`), a contrast of interest in the exposure (`delta`, which defaults to 1), and a \"true\" standardized mean difference (true, which defaults to 0). It calculates the odds ratio using the formula from Chinn (2000) and VanderWeele (2017), and then uses this to calculate the E-value.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#evalue for ols\ncompute_evalue_ols <- function(est, se, delta = 1, true = 0) {\n  # rescale estimate and SE to get a contrast of size delta\n  est <- est / delta\n  se <- se / delta\n\n  # compute transformed odds ratio and ci's\n  odds_ratio <- exp(0.91 * est)\n  lo <- exp(0.91 * est - 1.78 * se)\n  hi <- exp(0.91 * est + 1.78 * se)\n\n  # compute E-Values based on the RR values\n  evalue_point_estimate <- odds_ratio * sqrt(odds_ratio + 1)\n  evalue_lower_ci <- lo * sqrt(lo + 1)\n\n  # return the e-values\n  return(list(EValue_PointEstimate = evalue_point_estimate,\n              EValue_LowerCI = evalue_lower_ci))\n}\n\n\n# example:\n# suppose we have an estimate of 0.5, a standard error of 0.1, and a standard deviation of 1.\n# this would correspond to a half a standard deviation increase in the outcome per unit increase in the exposure.\nresults <- compute_evalue_ols(est = 0.5, se = 0.1, delta = 1)\npoint_round <- round(results$EValue_PointEstimate, 3)\nci_round <- round(results$EValue_LowerCI, 3)\n\n# print results\nprint(point_round)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.53\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(ci_round)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.009\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nWe write:\n\n> With an observed risk ratio of 2.53, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with both the outcome and the exposure by a risk ratio of 2.53-fold each, above and beyond the measured confounders, could explain away the estimate, but weaker joint confounder associations could not; to move the confidence interval to include the null, an unmeasured confounder that was associated with the outcome and the exposure by a risk ratio of 2.009-fold each could do so, but weaker joint confounder associations could not.\n\nNote the E-values package will do the computational work for us and this is what we use in the `margot` package to obtain E-values for sensitivity analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Part 2 Guide For Preparing Your Study\n\n\nRecall that psychology begins with two questions. \n\n> What do I want to know about thought and behaviour? \n> What is the target population? \n\nIn cross-cultural psychology, these questions relate to differences, and similarities, between groups.\n\nSuppose we have asked a question. How can we address it using observational data?\n\nToo fast.\n\nOur question must be made precise. \n\nToday we will consider how to make psychological questions precise, and how to answer them, using 3-wave panel designs [@vanderweele2020].\n\nThe order is as follows:\n\n1. **Motivate Three Wave Longitudinal Designs Using Causal Graphs**\n2. **Checklist For Causal Estimation in Three Wave Longitudinal Designs**\n3. **Explanation of the the Checklist**\n\n\n## Motivations for a Three-Wave Longitudinal Design for Observational Causal Inference. \n\nREVIEW: \nCausal Diagrammes (DAGS) are a remarkably powerful and simple tool for understanding confounding [See here](https://osf.io/b23k7) \n\n### Common cause of exposure and outcome.\n\nOur question: does visiting a clinical psychologist reduce the 10 year incidence of heart attacks?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Common cause of exposure and outcome: example](09-content_files/figure-html/fig-dag-1-1.png){#fig-dag-1 width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n### Solution: Adjust for Confounder\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Solution to this problem.](09-content_files/figure-html/fig-dag-2-1.png){#fig-dag-2 width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n### Bias: exposure at baseline is a common cause of the exposure at t1 and outcome at t2\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Causal graph reveals bias from pre-exosure indicator](09-content_files/figure-html/fig-dag-3-1.png){#fig-dag-3 width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n### Solution: adjust for confounder at baseline\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Solution to this problem](09-content_files/figure-html/fig-dag-4-1.png){#fig-dag-4 width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n### A more thorough confounding control\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Causal graph:more general panel design](09-content_files/figure-html/fig-dag-5-1.png){#fig-dag-5 width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n### Generic 3-wave panel design (VanderWeeele 2020)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Causal graph: three-wave panel design](09-content_files/figure-html/fig-dag-6-1.png){#fig-dag-6 width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\n\n\n## Comprehensive Checklist for Detailed Reporting of a Causal Inferenctial Study.\n\n## STEP 1 Formulate the Research Question\n\n-   **State your question:** is my question clearly stated? If not, state it.\n-   **Relevance:** have I explained its importance? If not, explain.\n-   **Ethics** how might this question affect people? How might not investigating this question affect people? \n-   **Causality:** Is my question causal? If not, refine your question.\n-   **Subgroup analysis:** does my question involve a subgroup (e.g., cultural group)? If not, develop a subgroup analysis question.\n-   **Explain the Framework:** can I explain the causal inference framework and convey the gist to non-specialists? If not, review course materials.\n\n#### Determine Data Requirements\n\n-   **Data types:** are my data experimental? If yes, your project may not fit this course.\n-   **Time-series data:** are my data time-series? If not, reconsider your causal question.\n-   **Data waves:** do I have at least three waves of data? If not, beware of confounding control issues.\n-   **Data source:** are my data from the NZAVS simulated data set? If not, consult with me.\n\n#### Determine the Outcome\n\n-   **Outcome variable:** is the outcome variable *Y* defined? If not, define it.\n-   **Multiple outcomes:** are there multiple outcomes?

If yes, consider logistic regression. If my outcome is continuous, consider z-transforming it or categorising it (consult an expert).\n-   **Outcome timing:** does the outcome appear after the exposure? It should.\n\n#### Determine the Exposure\n\n-   **Exposure variable:** is the exposure variable *A* defined? If not, define it.\n-   **Multiple exposures:** are there multiple exposures? If yes, reassess; if only one exposure, proceed.\n-   **Exposure relevance:** can I explain how the exposure variable relates to my question? If not, clarify.\n-   **Positivity:** can we intervene on the exposure at all levels of the covariates? We should be able to.\n-   **Consistency:** can I interpret what it means to intervene on the exposure? I should be able to.\n-   **Exchangeability:** are different versions of the exposure conditionally exchangeable given measured baseline confounders? They should be.\n-   **Exposure type:** is the exposure binary or continuous?\n-   **Shift intervention**: Am I contrasting static interventions or modified treatment policies? \n-   **Exposure timing:** Does the exposure appear before the outcome?

They should be.\n-   **Sufficiency:** Are the baseline confounders sufficient to ensure balance on the exposure, such that *A* is independent of *Y* given *L*? If not, plan a sensitivity analysis.\n-   **Confounder type:** Are the confounders continuous or binary? If so, consider converting them to z-scores. If they are categorical with three or more levels, do not convert them to z-scores.\n\n#### Draw a Causal Diagram with Unmeasured Confounders\n\n-   **Unmeasured confounders:** Does previous science suggest the presence of unmeasured confounders? If not, expand your understanding.\n-   **Causal diagram:** Have I drawn a causal diagram (DAG) to highlight both measured and unmeasured sources of confounding?

If not, we'll discuss later.\n-   **Temporal order:** Does my DAG have time indicators to ensure correct temporal order? It should.\n-   **Time consistency:** Is my DAG organized so that time follows in a consistent direction? It should.\n\n#### Identify the Estimand\n\n-   **Causal Estimand:** Is my causal estimand one of the following:\n\n$$ATE_{G,(A,A')} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|G, L]$$\n\n$$ATE_{G,(A/A')} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|G, L]}{E[Y(0)|G, L]}$$\n\nA modified treatment policy, e.g.\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{d}^\\lambda (a_1) = \\begin{cases} 4 & \\text{if } a_1 < 4 \\\\ \na_1 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{d}^\\phi (a_1) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } a_1 > 0 \\\\ \na_1 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n$$ g' = \\text{Intervention 1 - Intervention 2} = E[Y(\\mathbf{d}^\\lambda) - Y(\\mathbf{d}^\\phi)] $$\n\n$$ g'' = \\text{Intervention 1 - Intervention 2} = E[Y(\\mathbf{d}^\\lambda) - Y(\\mathbf{d}^\\phi)] $$\n\n$$\n{\\gamma}(g) ={g'} - {g''}\n$$\n\nIf yes, you're on the right track.\n\n#### Understanding Source and Target Populations\n\n-   **Populations identified:** Have I explained how my sample relates to my target populations? I should have.\n-   **Generalisability and transportability:** Have I considered whether my results generalise different populations?

I should have.\n\n#### Selecting the Model Approach: If Not Using Machine Learning (Lecture 7)\n\n-   **Approach decision:** Have I decided on using G-computation, IPTW, or Doubly-Robust Estimation? I should have.\n-   **Interactions:** If not using machine learning, have I included the interaction of the exposure and baseline covariates? I should have.\n-   **Big data:** If I have a large data set, should I include the interaction of the exposure, group, and baseline confounders? I should consider it.\n-   **Model specification:** have I double-checked the model specification? I should.\n-   **Outcome assessment:** If the outcome is rare and binary, have I specified logistic regression? If it's continuous, have I considered converting it to z-scores?\n-   **Sensitivity analysis:** am I planning a sensitivity analysis using simulation? If yes, describe it (e.g. E-values.)\n\n#### If Machine Learing\n\n-  **Machine Learning**: have I explained how semi-parametric ensemble machine learning works? (see example below).\n\n### d. Highlight unmeasured pre-treatment covariates\n\nLet **U** denoted unmeasured pre-treatment covariates that may potentially bias the statistical association between *A* and *Y* independently of the measured covariates.\n\n#### Consider:\n\n-   To affect *Y* and *A*, *U* must occur before *A*.\n-   It is useful to draw a causal diagramme to illustrate all potential sources of bias.\n-   Causal diagrammes are qualitative tools that require specialist expertise. We cannot typically obtain a causal graph from the data.\n-   A causal diagramme should include only as much information as is required to assess confounding. See @fig-dag-outcomewide for an example.\n-   Because we cannot ensure the absence of unmeasured confounders in observational settings, it is vital to conduct sensitivity analyses for the results. For sensitivity analyeses, we use E-values.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Causal graph: three-wave panel design.](09-content_files/figure-html/fig-dag-outcomewide-1.png){#fig-dag-outcomewide width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n### e. Choose the scale for a causal contrast\n\nAverage causal effects can be inferred by contrasting the expected outcome when a population is exposed to an exposure level, $E[Y(A = a)]$, with the expected outcome under a different exposure level, $E[Y(A=a')]$.\n\nFor a binary treatment with levels $A=0$ and $A=1$, the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), on the difference scale, is expressed:\n\n$$ATE_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1)|L] - E[Y(0)|L]$$\n\nOn the risk ratio scale, the ATE is expressed:\n\n$$ATE_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}$$\n\nOther effect scales, such as the incidence rate ratio, incidence rate difference, or hazard ratio, might also be of interest. We can also define the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) :\n\n$$ATT_{\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|A=1,L]$$\n\n$$ATT_{\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|A=1,L]}{E[Y(0)|A=1, L]}$$\n\nAnother common estimand is the Population Average Treatment Effect (PATE), which denotes the effect the treatment would have on the entire population if applied universally to that population. This quantity can be expressed:\n\n$$PATE_{\\text{risk difference}} = f(E[Y(1) - Y(0)|L], W)$$\n\n$$PATE_{\\text{risk ratio}} = f\\left(\\frac{E[Y(1)|L]}{E[Y(0)|L]}, W\\right)$$\n\nwhere $f$ is a function that incorporates weights $W$ into the estimation of the expected outcomes. These weights are given from census estimates for the wider population. Note: I will show you how to use weights in future seminars.\n\nWe might also be interested in identifying effects specific to certain strata, such as risk differences or risk ratios, as they are modified by baseline indicators. Denote a stratum of interest by $G$. We may then compute:\n\n$$ATE_{G,\\text{risk difference}} = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|G, L]$$\n\n$$ATE_{G,\\text{risk ratio}} = \\frac{E[Y(1)|G, L]}{E[Y(0)|G, L]}$$\n\n#### Consider:\n\n-   *In this course, we are interested in stratum specific comparisons*\n-   In the causal inference literature, the concept we use to make sense of stratum specific comparisons is called \"effect modification.\"\n-   By inferring effects within strata, we may evaluate whether the effects of different exposures or treatments on some well-defined outcome (measured in some well-defined time-period after the exposure) differ depending on group measurement.\n-   The logic of effect modification differs slightly from that of interaction.\n\n#### Aside: extensions\n\nFor continuous exposures, we must stipulate the level of contrast for the exposure (e.g. weekly versus monthly church attendance):\n\n$$ATE_{A,A'} = E[Y(A) - Y(A')| L]$$\n\nThis essentially denotes an average treatment effect comparing the outcome under treatment level $A$ to the outcome under treatment level $A'$.\n\nLikewise:\n\n$$ATE_{A/A'} = \\frac{E[Y(A)| L]}{E[Y(A')| L]}$$\n\nThis defines the contrast of $A$ and $A'$ on a ratio scale.\n\n#### f. Describe the population(s) for whom the intended study is meant to generalise by distinguishing between source and target populations.\n\nConsider the following concepts:\n\n-   **Source population**: a source population is where we gather our data for a study. We pull our specific sample from this group. It needs to mirror the broader group for our conclusions to be valid and widely applicable.\n\n-   **Target population**: the target population is the larger group we aim to apply our study's results to. It could be defined by location, demographics, or specific conditions. The closer the source matches the target in ways that are relevant to our causal questions, the stronger our causal inferences about the target population will be.\n\n    -   **Generalisability** refers to the ability to apply the causal effects estimated from a sample to the population it was drawn from. In simpler terms, it deals with the extrapolation of causal knowledge from a sample to the broader population. This concept is also called \"external validity\".\n\n$$\\text{Generalisability} = PATE \\approx ATE_{\\text{sample}}$$\n\n-   **Transportability** refers to the ability to extrapolate causal effects learned from a source population to a target population when certain conditions are met. It deals with the transfer of causal knowledge across different settings or populations.\n\n$$\\text{Transportability} = ATE_{\\text{target}} \\approx f(ATE_{\\text{source}}, T)$$\n\nwhere $f$ is a function and $T$ is a function that maps the results from our source population to another population. To achieve transportability, we need information about the source and target populations and an understanding of how the relationships between treatment, outcome, and covariates differ between the populations. Assessing transportability requires scientific knowledge.\n\n### Summary Step 1: Consider how much we need to do when asking a causal question!\n\nWe discover that asking a causal question is a multifaceted task. It demands careful definition of the outcome, including its timing, the exposure, and covariates. It also requires selecting the appropriate scale for causal contrast, controlling for confounding, and potentially adjusting for sample weights or stratification. Finally, when asking a causal question, we must consider for whom the results apply. Only after following these steps can we then ask: \"How may we answer this causal question?\"\n\n## STEP 2: ANSWER A CAUSAL QUESTION\n\n#### Obtain longitudinal data\n\nNote that causal inference from observational data turns on the appropriate temporal ordering of the key variables involved in the study.\n\nRecall we have defined.\n\n-   **A**: Our exposure or treatment variable, denoted as **A**. Here we consider the example of 'Church attendance'.\n\n-   **Y**: The outcome variable we are interested in, represented by **Y**, is psychological distress. We operationalise this variable through the 'Kessler-6' distress scale.\n\n-   **L**: The confounding variables, collectively referred to as **L**, represent factors that can independently influence both **A** and **Y**. For example, socio-economic status could be a confounder that impacts both the likelihood of church attendance and the levels of psychological distress.\n\nGiven the importance of temporal ordering, we must now define time:\n\n-   **t** $\\in$ T: Let $t$ denote within a multiwave panel study with **T** measurement intervals.\n\nWhere $t/\\text{{exposure}}$ denotes the measurement interval for the exposure. Longitudinal data collection provides us the ability to establish a causal model such that:\n\n$$t_{confounders} < t_{exposure}< t_{outcome}$$\n\nTo minimise the posibility of time-varying confounding and obtain the clearest effect estimates, we should acquire the most recent values of $\\mathbf{L}$ preceding $A$ and the latest values of $A$ before $Y$.\n\nNote in @fig-dag-outcomewide, We use the prefixes \"t0, t1, and t2\" to denote temporal ordering. We include in the set of baseline confounders the pre-exposure measurement of *A* and *Y*. This allows for more substantial confounding control. For unmeasured confounder to affect both the exposure and the outcome, it would need to do so independently of the pre-exposure confounders. Additionally, including the baseline exposure gives us an effect estimate for the incidence exposure, rather than the prevelance of the exposure. This helps us to assess the expected change in the outcome were we to initate a change in the exposure.\n\n### Include the measured exposure with baseline covariates\n\nControlling for prior exposure enables the interpretation of the effect estimate as a change in the exposure in a manner akin to a randomised trial. We propose that the effect estimate with prior control for the exposure estimates the \"incidence exposure\" rather than the \"prevalence exposure\" [@danaei2012]. It is crucial to estimate the incidence exposure because if the effects of an exposure are harmful in the short term such that these effects are not subsequently measured, a failure to adjust for prior exposure will yield the illusion that the exposure is beneficial. Furthermore, this approach aids in controlling for unmeasured confounding. For such a confounder to explain away the observed exposure-outcome association, it would need to do so independently of the prior level of the exposure and outcome.\n\n### State the eligibility criteria for participation\n\nThis step is invaluable for assessing whether we are answering the causal question that we have asked.\n\n#### Consider:\n\n-   Generalisability: we cannot evaluate inferences to a target group from the source population if we do not describe the source population\n-   Eligibility criteria will help us to ensure whether we have correctly evaluated potential measurement bias/error in our instruments.\n\nFor example, the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study is a National Probability study of New Zealanders. The details provided in the supplementary materials describe how individuals were randomly selected from the country's electoral roll.

The process involves five main steps:\n\n**Step 1** involves the estimation of the propensity score, a measure of the conditional probability of exposure given the covariates and the subgroup indicator. This score is calculated using statistical models such as logistic regression, with the model choice depending on the nature of the data and exposure. Weights for each individual are then calculated using this propensity score. These weights depend on the exposure status and are computed differently for exposed and unexposed individuals. The estimation of propensity scores is performed separately within each subgroup stratum.\n\n**Step 2** focuses on fitting a weighted outcome model, making use of the previously calculated weights from the propensity scores. This model estimates the outcome conditional on exposure, covariates, and subgroup, integrating the weights into the estimation process. Unlike in propensity score model estimation, covariates are included as variables in the outcome model. This inclusion makes the method doubly robust - providing a consistent effect estimate if either the propensity score or the outcome model is correctly specified, thereby reducing the assumption of correct model specification.\n\n**Step 3** entails the simulation of potential outcomes for each individual in each subgroup. These hypothetical scenarios assume universal exposure to the intervention within each subgroup, regardless of actual exposure levels. The expectation of potential outcomes is calculated for each individual in each subgroup, using individual-specific weights. These scenarios are performed for both the current and alternative interventions.\n\n**Step 4** is the estimation of the average causal effect for each subgroup, achieved by comparing the computed expected values of potential outcomes under each intervention level. The difference represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure within each subgroup. \n\n**Step 5** involves comparing differences in causal effects across groups by calculating the differences in the estimated causal effects between different subgroups. Confidence intervals and standard errors for these calculations are determined using simulation-based inference methods [@greifer2023]. This step allows for a comprehensive comparison of the impact of different interventions across various subgroups, while encorporating uncertainty.\n\n### Inference\n\nConsider the following ideas about what to discuss in one's findings:\nConsider the following ideas about what to discuss in one's findings.

Fit a model for the outcome $Y$, conditional on the exposure $A$, the covariates $L$, and subgroup indicator $G$. This model can be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another statistical model. The goal is to capture the relationship between the outcome, exposure, confounders, and subgroups.\n\n$$ \\hat{E}(Y|A,L,G) = f_Y(A,L,G; \\theta_Y) $$\n\nThis equation represents the expected value of the outcome $Y$ given the exposure $A$, covariates $L$, and subgroup $G$, as modelled by the function $f_Y$ with parameters $\\theta_Y$. This formulation allows for the prediction of the average outcome $Y$ given certain values of $A$, $L$, and $G$.\n\n**Step 2:** Simulate potential outcomes. For each individual in each subgroup, predict their potential outcome under the intervention $A=a$ using the estimated outcome model:\n\n$$\\hat{E}(Y(a)|G=g) = \\hat{E}[Y|A=a,L,G=g; \\hat{\\theta}_Y]$$\n\nWe also predict the potential outcome for everyone in each subgroup under the causal contrast, setting the intervention for everyone in that group to $A=a'$:\n\n$$\\hat{E}(Y(a')|G=g) = \\hat{E}[Y|A=a',L,G=g; \\hat{\\theta}_Y]$$\n\nIn these equations, $Y$ represents the potential outcome, $A$ is the intervention, $L$ are the covariates, $G=g$ represents the subgroup, and $\\theta_Y$ are the parameters of the outcome model.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the estimated difference for each subgroup $g$:\n\n$$\\hat{\\delta}_g = \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \\hat{E}[Y(a')|G=g]$$\n\nThis difference $\\hat{\\delta}_g$ represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure from level $a'$ to level $a$ within each subgroup $g$.\n\nWe use simulation-based inference methods to compute standard errors and confidence intervals [@greifer2023].\n\n**Step 4:** Compare differences in causal effects by subgroups:\n\n$$\\hat{\\gamma} = \\hat{\\delta}_g - \\hat{\\delta}_{g'}$$\n\nwhere,\n\n$$\\hat{\\gamma} = \\overbrace{\\big( \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \\hat{E}[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g] \\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_g}} - \\overbrace{\\big(\\hat{E}[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g^{\\prime}]- \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g^{\\prime}]\\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_{g^{\\prime}}}}$$\n\nThis difference $\\hat{\\gamma}$ represents the difference in the average causal effects between the subgroups $g$ and $g'$. It measures the difference in effect of the exposure $A$ within subgroup $G$ on the outcome $Y$.\n\n\n[^note_care] \n\n[^note_care]: $A$ and $G$ on $Y$ might not be additive. We assume that the potential confounders $L$ are sufficient to control for confounding. See Appendix\n\n\nWe again use simulation-based inference methods to compute standard errors and confidence intervals [@greifer2023].\n\n\n\n\n### Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) for Subgroup Analysis Estimator\n\n\n**Step 1:** Estimate the propensity score. The propensity score $e(L, G)$ is the conditional probability of the exposure $A = 1$, given the covariates $L$ and subgroup indicator $G$. This can be modeled using logistic regression or other suitable methods, depending on the nature of the data and the exposure.\n\n$$\\hat{e} = P(A = 1 | L, G) = f_A(L, G; \\theta_A)$$\n\nHere, $f_A(L, G; \\theta_A)$ is a function (statistical model) that estimates the probability of the exposure $A = 1$ given covariates $L$ and subgroup $G$. Then, we calculate the weights for each individual, denoted as $v$, using the estimated propensity score:\n\n$$\nv = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\frac{1}{\\hat{e}} & \\text{if } A = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{1-\\hat{e}} & \\text{if } A = 0 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Step 2:** Fit a weighted outcome model. Using the weights calculated from the estimated propensity scores, fit a model for the outcome $Y$, conditional on the exposure $A$ and subgroup $G$. This can be represented as:\n\n$$ \\hat{E}(Y|A, G; V) = f_Y(A, G ; \\theta_Y, V) $$\n\nIn this model, $f_Y$ is a function (such as a weighted regression model) with parameters $θ_Y$.\n\n**Step 3:** Simulate potential outcomes. For each individual in each subgroup, simulate their potential outcome under the hypothetical scenario where everyone in the subgroup is exposed to the intervention $A=a$ regardless of their actual exposure level:\n\n$$\\hat{E}(Y(a)|G=g) = \\hat{E}[Y|A=a,G=g; \\hat{\\theta}_Y, v]$$\n\nAnd also under the hypothetical scenario where everyone is exposed to intervention $A=a'$:\n\n$$\\hat{E}(Y(a')|G=g) = \\hat{E}[Y|A=a',G=g; \\hat{\\theta}_Y, v]$$\n\n**Step 4:** Estimate the average causal effect for each subgroup as the difference in the predicted outcomes:\n\n$$\\hat{\\delta}_g = \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \\hat{E}[Y(a')|G=g]$$\n\nThe estimated difference $\\hat{\\delta}_g$ represents the average causal effect within group $g$.\n\n**Step 5:** Compare differences in causal effects by groups. Compute the differences in the estimated causal effects between different subgroups:\n\n$$\\hat{\\gamma} = \\hat{\\delta}_g - \\hat{\\delta}_{g'}$$\n\nwhere,\n\n$$\\hat{\\gamma} = \\overbrace{\\big( \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \\hat{E}[Y(a')|G=g] \\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_g}} - \\overbrace{\\big(\\hat{E}[Y(a')|G=g']- \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g']\\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_{g'}}}$$\n\nThis $\\hat{\\gamma}$ represents the difference in the average causal effects between the subgroups $g$ and $g'$.\n\n\nWe again use simulation-based inference methods to compute standard errors and confidence intervals [@greifer2023].\n\n\n### Doubly Robust Estimation for Subgroup Analysis Estimator\nIt appears that the Doubly Robust Estimation explanation for subgroup analysis is already clear and correct, covering all the necessary steps in the process. Nevertheless, there's a slight confusion in step 4. The difference $\\delta_g$ is not defined within the document. I assume that you intended to write $\\hat{\\delta}_g$. Here's the corrected version:\n\n### Doubly Robust Estimation for Subgroup Analysis Estimator\n\nDoubly Robust Estimation is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of both the IPTW and G-computation methods. It uses both the propensity score model and the outcome model, which makes it doubly robust: it produces unbiased estimates if either one of the models is correctly specified.\n\n**Step 1** Estimate the propensity score. The propensity score $\\hat{e}(L, G)$ is the conditional probability of the exposure $A = 1$, given the covariates $L$ and subgroup indicator $G$. This can be modeled using logistic regression or other suitable methods, depending on the nature of the data and the exposure.\n\n$$\\hat{e} = P(A = 1 | L, G) = f_A(L, G; \\theta_A)$$\n\nHere, $f_A(L, G; \\theta_A)$ is a function (statistical model) that estimates the probability of the exposure $A = 1$ given covariates $L$ and subgroup $G$. Then, we calculate the weights for each individual, denoted as $v$, using the estimated propensity score:\n\n$$\nv = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\frac{1}{\\hat{e}} & \\text{if } A = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{1-\\hat{e}} & \\text{if } A = 0 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Step 2** Fit a weighted outcome model. Using the weights calculated from the estimated propensity scores, fit a model for the outcome $Y$, conditional on the exposure $A$, covariates $L$, and subgroup $G$.\n\n$$ \\hat{E}(Y|A, L, G; V) = f_Y(A, L, G ; \\theta_Y, V) $$\n\n**Step 3** For each individual in each subgroup, simulate their potential outcome under the hypothetical scenario where everyone in the subgroup is exposed to the intervention $A=a$ regardless of their actual exposure level:\n\n$$\\hat{E}(Y(a)|G=g) = \\hat{E}[Y|A=a,G=g; L,\\hat{\\theta}_Y, v]$$\n\nAnd also under the hypothetical scenario where everyone in each subgroup is exposed to intervention $A=a'$:\n\n$$\\hat{E}(Y(a')|G=g) = \\hat{E}[Y|A=a',G=g; L; \\hat{\\theta}_Y, v]$$\n\n**Step 4** Estimate the average causal effect for each subgroup. Compute the estimated expected value of the potential outcomes under each intervention level for each subgroup:\n\n$$\\hat{\\delta}_g = \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \\hat{E}[Y(a')|G=g]$$\n\nThe estimated difference $\\hat{\\delta}_g$ represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure from level $a'$ to level $a$ within each subgroup.\n\n**Step 5** Compare differences in causal effects by groups. Compute the differences in the estimated causal effects between different subgroups:\n\n$$\\hat{\\gamma} = \\hat{\\delta}_g - \\hat{\\delta}_{g'}$$\n\nwhere,\n\n$$\\hat{\\gamma} = \\overbrace{\\big( \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \\hat{E}[Y(a')|G=g] \\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_g}} - \\overbrace{\\big(\\hat{E}[Y(a')|G=g']- \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g']\\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_{g'}}}$$\n\n\nWe again use simulation-based inference methods to compute standard errors and confidence intervals [@greifer2023].\n\n\n## Appendix B: G-computation for Subgroup Analysis Estimator with Non-Additive Effects\n\n**Step 1:** Estimate the outcome model. Fit a model for the outcome $Y$, conditional on the exposure $A$, the covariates $L$, subgroup indicator $G$, and interactions between $A$ and $G$. This model can be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another statistical model. The goal is to capture the relationship between the outcome, exposure, confounders, subgroups, and their interactions.\n\n$$ \\hat{E}(Y|A,L,G,AG) = f_Y(A,L,G,AG; \\theta_Y) $$\n\nThis equation represents the expected value of the outcome $Y$ given the exposure $A$, covariates $L$, subgroup $G$, and interaction term $AG$, as modeled by the function $f_Y$ with parameters $\\theta_Y$. \n\n**Step 2:** Simulate potential outcomes. For each individual in each subgroup, predict their potential outcome under the intervention $A=a$ using the estimated outcome model:\n\n$$\\hat{E}(Y(a)|G=g) = \\hat{E}[Y|A=a,L,G=g,AG=ag; \\hat{\\theta}_Y]$$\n\nWe also predict the potential outcome for everyone in each subgroup under the causal contrast, setting the intervention for everyone in that group to $A=a'$:\n\n$$\\hat{E}(Y(a')|G=g) = \\hat{E}[Y|A=a',L,G=g,AG=a'g; \\hat{\\theta}_Y]$$\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the estimated difference for each subgroup $g$:\n\n$$\\hat{\\delta}_g = \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \\hat{E}[Y(a')|G=g]$$\n\n**Step 4:** Compare differences in causal effects by subgroups:\n\n$$\\hat{\\gamma} = \\hat{\\delta}_g - \\hat{\\delta}_{g'}$$\n\nwhere,\n\n$$\\hat{\\gamma} = \\overbrace{\\big( \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \\hat{E}[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g] \\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_g}} - \\overbrace{\\big(\\hat{E}[Y(a^{\\prime})|G=g^{\\prime}]- \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g^{\\prime}]\\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_{g^{\\prime}}}}$$\n\nThis difference $\\hat{\\gamma}$ represents the difference in the average causal effects between the subgroups $g$ and $g'$, taking into account the interaction effect of the exposure $A$ and the subgroup $G$ on the outcome $Y$.\n\nNote that the interaction term $AG$ (or $ag$ and $a'g$ in the potential outcomes) stands for the interaction between the exposure level and the subgroup. This term is necessary to accommodate the non-additive effects in the model. As before, we must ensure that potential confounders $L$ are sufficient to control for confounding. \n\n## Appendix C: Doubly Robust Estimation for Subgroup Analysis Estimator with Interaction\n\nAgain, Doubly Robust Estimation combines the strengths of both the IPTW and G-computation methods. It uses both the propensity score model and the outcome model, which makes it doubly robust: it produces unbiased estimates if either one of the models is correctly specified.\n\n**Step 1** Estimate the propensity score. The propensity score $e(L, G)$ is the conditional probability of the exposure $A = 1$, given the covariates $L$ and subgroup indicator $G$. This can be modeled using logistic regression or other suitable methods, depending on the nature of the data and the exposure.\n\n$$e = P(A = 1 | L, G) = f_A(L, G; \\theta_A)$$\n\nHere, $f_A(L, G; \\theta_A)$ is a function (statistical model) that estimates the probability of the exposure $A = 1$ given covariates $L$ and subgroup $G$. Then, we calculate the weights for each individual, denoted as $v$, using the estimated propensity score:\n\n$$\nv = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\frac{1}{\\hat{e}} & \\text{if } A = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{1-\\hat{e}} & \\text{if } A = 0 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Step 2** Fit a weighted outcome model. Using the weights calculated from the estimated propensity scores, fit a model for the outcome $Y$, conditional on the exposure $A$, covariates $L$, subgroup $G$ and the interaction between $A$ and $G$.\n\n$$ \\hat{E}(Y|A, L, G, AG; V) = f_Y(A, L, G, AG ; \\theta_Y, V) $$\n\n**Step 3** For each individual in each subgroup, simulate their potential outcome under the hypothetical scenario where everyone in the subgroup is exposed to the intervention $A=a$ regardless of their actual exposure level:\n\n$$\\hat{E}(Y(a)|G=g) = \\hat{E}[Y|A=a,G=g, AG=ag; L,\\hat{\\theta}_Y, v]$$\n\nAnd also under the hypothetical scenario where everyone in each subgroup is exposed to intervention $A=a'$:\n\n$$\\hat{E}(Y(a')|G=g) = \\hat{E}[Y|A=a',G=g, AG=a'g; L; \\hat{\\theta}_Y, v]$$\n\n**Step 4** Estimate the average causal effect for each subgroup. Compute the estimated expected value of the potential outcomes under each intervention level for each subgroup:\n\n$$\\hat{\\delta}_g = \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \\hat{E}[Y(a')|G=g]$$\n\nThe estimated difference $\\hat{\\delta}_g$ represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure from level $a'$ to level $a$ within each subgroup.\n\n**Step 5** Compare differences in causal effects by groups. Compute the differences in the estimated causal effects between different subgroups:\n\n$$\\hat{\\gamma} = \\hat{\\delta}_g - \\hat{\\delta}_{g'}$$\n\nwhere,\n\n$$\\hat{\\gamma} = \\overbrace{\\big( \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g] - \\hat{E}[Y(a')|G=g] \\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_g}} - \\overbrace{\\big(\\hat{E}[Y(a')|G=g']- \\hat{E}[Y(a)|G=g']\\big)}^{\\hat{\\delta_{g'}}}$$\n\nWe again use simulation-based inference methods to compute standard errors and confidence intervals [@greifer2023].\n\n\n\n## Appendix D: Marginal Structural Models for Estimating Population Average Treatment Effect with Interaction (Doubly Robust)\n\n\nSometimes we will only wish to estimate a marginal effect. In that case.\n\n**Step 1** Estimate the propensity score. The propensity score $e(L)$ is the conditional probability of the exposure $A = 1$, given the covariates $L$ which contains the subgroup $G$. This can be modelled using logistic regression or other functions as described in @greifer2023\n\n$$\\hat{e} = P(A = 1 | L) = f_A(L; \\theta_A)$$\n\nHere, $f_A(L; \\theta_A)$ is a function (a statistical model) that estimates the probability of the exposure $A = 1$ given covariates $L$. Then, we calculate the weights for each individual, denoted as $v$, using the estimated propensity score:\n\n$$\nv = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\frac{1}{e} & \\text{if } A = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{1-e} & \\text{if } A = 0 \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Step 2** Fit a weighted outcome model. Using the weights calculated from the estimated propensity scores, fit a model for the outcome $Y$, conditional on the exposure $A$ and covariates $L$.\n\n$$ \\hat{E}(Y|A, L; V) = f_Y(A, L; \\theta_Y, V) $$\n\nThis model should include terms for both the main effects of $A$ and $L$ and their interaction $AL$.\n\n**Step 3** For the entire population, simulate the potential outcome under the hypothetical scenario where everyone is exposed to the intervention $A=a$ regardless of their actual exposure level:\n\n$$\\hat{E}(Y(a)) = \\hat{E}[Y|A=a; L,\\hat{\\theta}_Y, v]$$\n\nAnd also under the hypothetical scenario where everyone is exposed to intervention $A=a'$:\n\n$$\\hat{E}(Y(a')) = \\hat{E}[Y|A=a'; L; \\hat{\\theta}_Y, v]$$\n\n**Step 4** Estimate the average causal effect for the entire population. Compute the estimated expected value of the potential outcomes under each intervention level for the entire population:\n\n$$\\hat{\\delta} = \\hat{E}[Y(a)] - \\hat{E}[Y(a')]$$\n\nThe estimated difference $\\hat{\\delta}$ represents the average causal effect of changing the exposure from level $a'$ to level $a$ in the entire population.\n\nWe again use simulation-based inference methods to compute standard errors and confidence intervals [@greifer2023].\n\n\n### Machine Learning\n\nExample from https://osf.io/cnphs\n\n\n> We perform statistical estimation using semi-parametric Targeted\nLearning, specifically a Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE)\nestimator. TMLE is a robust method that combines machine learning\ntechniques with traditional statistical models to estimate causal\neffects while providing valid statistical uncertainty measures for these\nestimates [@van2012targeted; @van2014targeted].\n\n> TMLE operates through a two-step process that involves modelling both\nthe outcome and treatment (exposure). Initially, TMLE employs machine\nlearning algorithms to flexibly model the relationship between\ntreatments, covariates, and outcomes. This flexibility allows TMLE to\naccount for complex, high-dimensional covariate spaces\n\\emph{efficiently} without imposing restrictive model assumptions;\n[@vanderlaan2011; @vanderlaan2018]. The outcome of this step is a set\nof initial estimates for these relationships.\n\n> The second step of TMLE involves ``targeting'' these initial estimates\nby incorporating information about the observed data distribution to\nimprove the accuracy of the causal effect estimate. TMLE achieves this\nprecision through an iterative updating process, which adjusts the\ninitial estimates towards the true causal effect. This updating process\nis guided by the efficient influence function, ensuring that the final\nTMLE estimate is as close as possible, given the measures and data, to\nthe targeted causal effect while still being robust to\nmodel-misspecification in either the outcome or the treatment model\n[@van2014discussion].\n\n> Again, a central feature of TMLE is its double-robustness property. If\neither the treatment model or the outcome model is correctly specified,\nthe TMLE estimator will consistently estimate the causal effect.\nAdditionally, we used cross-validation to avoid over-fitting, following\nthe pre-stated protocols in Bulbulia [@bulbulia2024PRACTICAL]. The integration of TMLE\nand machine learning technologies reduces the dependence on restrictive\nmodelling assumptions and introduces an additional layer of robustness.\nFor further details of the specific targeted learning strategy we\nfavour, see [@duxedaz2021; @hoffman2022, @hoffman2023]. We perform estimation using the\n\\texttt{lmtp} package [@williams2021]. We used the \\texttt{superlearner} library for semi-parametric estimation with the predefined libraries \\texttt{SL.ranger},\n\\texttt{SL.glmnet}, and \\texttt{SL.xgboost} [@xgboost2023; @polley2023; @Ranger2017]. We created graphs, tables and output reports using the \\texttt{margot} package\n[@margot2024].\n\n#### Sensitivity Analysis Using the E-value\n\n> To assess the sensitivity of results to unmeasured confounding, we\nreport VanderWeele and Ding's ``E-value'' in all analyses\n[@vanderweele2017]. The E-value quantifies the minimum strength of association (on the risk ratio scale) that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure\nand the outcome (after considering the measured covariates) to explain\naway the observed exposure-outcome association\n[@linden2020EVALUE; @vanderweele2020]. To\nevaluate the strength of evidence, we use the bound of the E-value 95\\%\nconfidence interval closest to 1.\n\n\n\n\n### Packages\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreport::cite_packages()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  - Barrett M (2021). _ggokabeito: 'Okabe-Ito' Scales for 'ggplot2' and 'ggraph'_.
