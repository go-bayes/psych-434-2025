Causal inference gives us the tools to do this.\n\n\n## Causal inference asks: \"What if?\"\n\nThe core idea is to compare what *actually happened* with what *could have happened* under different conditions (these \"what ifs\" are called **counterfactuals**).\n\nImagine an outcome we care about, like student test scores ($Y$). We might compare the score if *everyone* got a new teaching method (let's call this condition $a^*$) versus if *everyone* got the old method (condition $a$).\n\nThe difference in the potential outcome ($Y$) under these two scenarios is the causal effect for one person: $Y(a^*) - Y(a)$.\n\nSince we can't see both scenarios for the same person, we often look at the average effect across a group. The **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** is the average difference in potential outcomes across the whole population:\n\n$$\n\\text{ATE} = \\mathbb{E}[Y(a^*) - Y(a)]\n$$\n\nThis asks: \"On average, how much would scores change if we switched everyone from the old method ($a$) to the new method ($a^*$)?\".\n\nA big challenge is dealing with **confounders** â€“ other factors that mix up the relationship between the treatment ($A$) and the outcome ($Y$), potentially misleading us about the true causal effect. We need to account for these.\n\n\n## What do 'Interaction' and 'Effect Modification' mean in Causal Inference?\n\nWords like 'moderation' and 'interaction' are often used loosely. Causal inference needs precise terms.\n\nWe'll focus on two specific ideas:\n\n1.  **Interaction:** About the effect of *combining* interventions.\n2.  **Effect Modification:** About how the effect of *one* intervention changes for different *types of people*.\n\n\n## Interaction: The Effect of Teamwork (or Lack Thereof)\n\n**Interaction** in causal inference is about **joint interventions**. We look at what happens when we apply *two or more different treatments* at the same time.\n\nLet's say we have two treatments, $A$ and $B$, and an outcome $Y$.\n\n* $Y(\\tilde{a})$ is the potential outcome if we set treatment $A$ to level $\\tilde{a}$.\n* $Y(\\tilde{b})$ is the potential outcome if we set treatment $B$ to level $\\tilde{b}$.\n* $Y(\\tilde{a}, \\tilde{b})$ is the potential outcome if we set $A$ to $\\tilde{a}$ *and* $B$ to $\\tilde{b}$ simultaneously.\n\nTo figure out these effects from observational data, we usually need assumptions like:\n\n- **Consistency:** The outcome we see for someone who got treatment $\\tilde{a}$ is the same as their potential outcome $Y(\\tilde{a})$.\n\n- **Conditional Exchangeability (No Unmeasured Confounding):** We can make the groups receiving different treatments comparable by adjusting for measured confounders ($L$ for $A \\to Y$, and $Q$ for $B \\to Y$). The sets $L$ and $Q$ might overlap.\n\n- **Positivity**: the exposures to be compared occur in all subgroups.\n\n\nTo study the *interaction* between $A$ and $B$, we need to be able to estimate the effect of $A$ and the effect of $B$, which means we need to adjust for *all* confounders in **both** $L$ and $Q$ (i.e., their union $L \\cup Q$).\n\n\n### Defining Interaction: Does 1 + 1 = 2?\n\nLet's use an education example:\n\n* $A$: New teaching method (1=New, 0=Old)\n* $B$: Extra tutoring (1=Yes, 0=No)\n* $Y$: Test score\n\nIs the boost in scores from getting *both* the new method *and* tutoring simply the sum of the boost from *only* the new method and the boost from *only* tutoring?\n\nWe define **causal interaction on the additive scale** (looking at differences) by comparing the effect of the joint intervention to the sum of the individual effects (all compared to getting neither):\n\n$$\n\\underbrace{(\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)])}_{\\text{Effect of Both}} \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad \\underbrace{(\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,0)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)])}_{\\text{Effect of A only}} + \\underbrace{(\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)])}_{\\text{Effect of B only}}\n$$\n\nInteraction exists if these are not equal. This simplifies to checking if the following is non-zero (see Appendix):\n\n$$\n\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,1)]}_{\\text{Both}} - \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,0)]}_{\\text{A only}} - \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,1)]}_{\\text{B only}} + \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]}_{\\text{Neither}} \\neq 0\n$$\n\n- If this is positive: **Synergy** (the combination is better than expected).\n- If this is negative: **Antagonism** (the combination is worse than expected).\n\n*(We could also look at interaction on other scales, like ratios, which might give different answers. Always state the scale you're using -- we'll come back to this in later lectures)*\n\n#### Finding Causal Interaction in Data\n\nTo estimate this interaction, we need valid estimates for all four average potential outcomes:\n\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)], \\mathbb{E}[Y(1,0)], \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,1)], \\mathbb{E}[Y(1,1)]$$\n\nThis means we must control for confounders of *both* the $A \\to Y$ link and the $B \\to Y$ link.\n\n@fig-dag-interaction shows this. $L$ are confounders for $A \\to Y$, and $Q$ are confounders for $B \\to Y$. We need to block the backdoor paths (red arrows).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Diagram illustrating causal interaction.

Boxes around L and Q indicate conditioning, closing backdoor paths.](06-content-short_files/figure-html/fig-dag-interaction-solved-1.png){#fig-dag-interaction-solved width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn our education example:\n\n- **L (Confounders for Teaching Method $\\to$ Score):** Prior achievement, motivation, family background (SES), school quality, teacher differences (if not randomly assigned).\n\n- **Q (Confounders for Tutoring $\\to$ Score):** Prior achievement, motivation, family background (SES - paying for tutoring), student availability, specific learning needs.\n\nNotice that prior achievement and motivation are in *both* $L$ and $Q$. We need to measure and adjust for *all* important factors in $L$ and $Q$ to get a reliable estimate of the interaction.\n\n\n## Effect Modification: Different Effects for Different People\n\nUnlike interaction (about combining treatments), **effect modification** is about whether the causal effect of a *single* intervention ($A$) on an outcome ($Y$) is *different* for different subgroups in the population. These subgroups are defined by baseline characteristics (like age, sex, prior history - let's call these $G$ or $X$).\n\nEffect modification helps us understand *who* benefits most (or least) from an intervention. We explore this using ideas like Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE).\n\n\n### Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE): The Idea of Variation\n\n**Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)** just means that the effect of a treatment ($A$ on $Y$) isn't the same for everyone. The effect *varies*. This variation *is* effect modification.\n\nWhy does it vary?\n\n- Differences in things we can measure (like age, sex, baseline health - our $X$ variables).\n- Differences in things we can't easily measure (like genetics, unmeasured background factors).\n\nHTE is the reality; treatments rarely work identically for all.\n\n\n### Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE): Measuring Variation with Data $\\tau(x)$\n\nTo study HTE using data, we focus on the\n\n**Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE)**. CATE is a specific *causal question (estimand)*: What is the average treatment effect *for the subgroup of people who share specific measured characteristics* $X=x$?\n\n$$\n\\tau(x) = \\text{CATE}(x) = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0) | X = x]\n$$\n\nHere, $Y(1)$ is the potential outcome with treatment, $Y(0)$ without. $\\tau(x)$ tells us the average effect specifically for people with characteristics $X=x$. By looking at how $\\tau(x)$ changes for different $x$, we quantify effect modification *by the characteristics we measured in X*.\n\n\n### Comparing Effects Across Defined Groups\n\nA simple way to check for effect modification by a category $G$ (like comparing males vs females, or different locations) is to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) *separately within each group*. This is like comparing CATEs where $X$ is just the group variable $G$.\n\nLet's say $A$ is the treatment (0=control, 1=treated) and $G$ is the potential modifier (e.g., $g=$female, $g'=$male).\n\nWe compare:\n\n1.  The average effect for females ($G=g_1$): $\\delta_{g_1} = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) | G=g_1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0) | G=g_1]$\n\n2.  The average effect for males ($G=g_2$): $\\delta_{g_2} = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) | G=g_2] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0) | G=g_2]$\n\nEffect modification by $G$ exists if these are different: $\\gamma = \\delta_{g_1} - \\delta_{g_2} \\neq 0$.\n\nIf our estimate $\\hat{\\gamma}$ is far from zero, it suggests the treatment effect differs between males and females.\n\n#### Finding Effect Modification in Data\n\nTo estimate these group-specific effects ($\\delta_g$) and their difference ($\\gamma$) correctly, we need to control for confounders ($L$) of the $A \\to Y$ relationship *within each group* defined by $G$. \n\nNote: we don't necessarily need to control for things that cause $G$ itself, *unless* they also confound the $A \\to Y$ relationship (i.e., are also in $L$).\n\nLook at @fig-dag-effect-modification. To estimate the $A \\to Y$ effect within levels of $G$, we need to adjust for the confounders $L_0$. But this will partially block the effect-modification of G on Y.  Moreover, if we were identifying the causal effect of G on Y, after conditioning on L, we would find that a backdoor path opends from G to Y because L is a collider.  We cannot interpret any coefficient for G in a regression model where L is in the model. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![How shall we investigate effect modification of A on Y by G? Can you see the problem?](06-content-short_files/figure-html/fig-dag-effect-modification-1.png){#fig-dag-effect-modification width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThus it is essential to understand that when we control for confounding along the the $A \\to Y$ path, we do not identify the causal effects of effect-modifiers. Rather, we should consider effect-modifiers *prognostic* indicators. Moreover, we're going to need to develop methods for clarifying prognostic indicators in multi-dimensional settings where \n\n\n## Estimating How Effects Vary: Getting $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ from Data\n\nWe defined the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE), $\\tau(x)$, as the *true* average effect for a subgroup with specific features $X=x$:\n\n$$\n\\tau(x) = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0) | X = x]\n$$\n\nNow, we want to *estimate* this from our actual data. We call our estimate $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$. For any person $i$ in our study with features $X_i$, the value $\\hat{\\tau}(X_i)$ is our data-based *prediction* of the average treatment effect *for people like person i*.\n\n### \"Personalised\" Effects vs. True Individual Effects\n\nWait - didn't we say we *can't* know the true effect for one specific person, $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$? Yes, that's still true.\n\nSo what does $\\hat{\\tau}(X_i)$ mean?\n\n- **Individual Causal Effect (Unknowable):** $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$. This is the true effect for person $i$. We can't observe both $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$.\n\n- **Estimated CATE ($\\hat{\\tau}(X_i)$) (What we calculate):** This is our estimate of the *average* effect, $\\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)]$, for the *subgroup* of people who share the same measured characteristics $X_i$ as person $i$.\n\nWhen people talk about \"personalised\" or \"individualised\" treatment effects in this context, they usually mean $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$. It's \"personalised\" because the prediction uses person $i$'s specific characteristics $X_i = x$. But remember, it's an **estimated average effect for a group**, not the unique effect for that single individual.\n\n### People Have Many Characteristics\n\nPeople aren't just in one group; they have many features at once. A student might be:\n\n- Female\n- 21 years old\n- From a low-income family\n- Did well on previous tests\n- Goes to a rural school\n- Highly motivated\n\nAll these factors ($X_i$) together might influence how they respond to a new teaching method.\n\nTrying to figure this out with traditional regression by manually adding interaction terms (like `A*gender*age*income*...`) becomes impossible very quickly:\n\n- Too many combinations, not enough data in each specific combo.\n- High risk of finding \"effects\" just by chance (false positives).\n- Hard to know which interactions to even include.\n- Can't easily discover unexpected patterns.\n\nThus, while simple linear regression with interaction terms (`lm(Y ~ A * X1 + A * X2)`) can estimate CATEs if the model is simple and correct, it often fails when things get complex (many $X$ variables, non-linear effects).\n\n**Causal forests** (using the `grf` package in R) [@grf2024] are a powerful, flexible alternative designed for this task. They build decision trees that specifically aim to find groups with different treatment effects.\n\nWe'll learn how to use `grf` after the mid-term break. It will allow us to get the $\\hat{\\tau}(x)$ predictions and then think about how to use them, for instance, to prioritise who gets a treatment if resources are limited.\n\n\n<!-- This is where modern methods like **causal forests** come in, which we'll come back to after the mid-term break. -->\n\n<!-- ### Causal Forests: A Modern Tool for Estimating $\\hat{\\tau}(X)$ -->\n\n<!-- Causal forests (implemented in the R package `grf`) are designed for this complex situation. They are like random forests but built specifically to find differences in *treatment effects*. -->\n\n<!-- How they help: -->\n<!-- 1.  **Look at all features ($X$) at once:** They automatically search across all measured characteristics to see which ones explain differences in the treatment effect. -->\n<!-- 2.  **Flexible:** They don't assume simple linear relationships and can find complex patterns. -->\n<!-- 3.  **Local Averaging:** The estimate $\\hat{\\tau}(X_i)$ for person $i$ is based on the outcomes of other people in the data who are \"similar\" to person $i$ based on their characteristics $X$. -->\n<!-- 4.  **\"Honest\" Estimates:** They use clever statistical techniques (like splitting the data) to try and give reliable estimates and confidence intervals, reducing the risk of overfitting. -->\n\n<!-- The result is a prediction $\\hat{\\tau}(X_i)$ for each person $i$, based on their unique combination of measured features $X_i$. This gets us closer to understanding effect heterogeneity in a realistic way. -->\n\n<!-- ### Why Estimate CATEs ($\\hat{\\tau}(X)$)? -->\n\n<!-- Estimating $\\hat{\\tau}(X)$ is how we investigate HTE using our measured data $X$. We look at how $\\hat{\\tau}(X)$ changes across different types of people (different $X$ values) to: -->\n\n<!-- 1.  **See if the effect varies:** Go beyond the overall average (ATE) and see *if* and *how* the effect differs. -->\n\n<!-- 2.  **Find subgroups:** Identify groups (defined by $X$) who might benefit much more (or less, or even be harmed) by the intervention. -->\n\n<!-- 3.  **Inform targeted policies:** Use the predictions $\\hat{\\tau}(X_i)$ to investigate if giving the treatment only to those predicted to benefit most would lead to better outcomes overall (we'll evaluate this later using tools like RATE curves -- again this is all coming after the mid-term break). -->\n\n\n### Summary\n\nLet's revisit the centeral ideas:\n\n####  **Interaction:**\n\n- **Think:** Teamwork effect.\n- **What:** Effect of *two or more different interventions* ($A$ and $B$) applied together.\n- **Question:** Is the joint effect $\\mathbb{E}[Y(a,b)]$ different from the sum of individual effects?\n- **Needs:** Control confounders for *all* interventions involved ($L \\cup Q$).\n\n####  **Effect Modification / HTE / CATE:**\n- **Think:** Different effects for different groups.\n- **What:** Effect of a *single intervention* ($A$) varies depending on people's *baseline characteristics* ($G$ or $X$).\n- **Question (HTE):** *Does* the effect vary? (The phenomenon).\n-  **Question (CATE $\\tau(x)$):** *What is* the average effect for a specific subgroup with features $X=x$? (The measure).\n- **Needs:** Control confounders for the *single* intervention ($L$) within subgroups.\n\n#### **Estimated \"Individualised\" Treatment Effects ($\\hat{\\tau}(x)$):**\n- **Think:** Personal profile prediction.\n- **What:** Our *estimate* of the average treatment effect for the subgroup of people sharing characteristics $X_i$.\n- **How:** Calculated using models (like causal forests) that use the person's full profile $X_i$.\n- **Important:** This is **not** the true effect for that single person (which is unknowable). It's an average for *people like them*.\n- **Use:** Explore HTE, identify subgroups, potentially inform targeted treatment strategies.\n\nKeeping these concepts distinct helps us ask clear research questions and choose the right methods.\n\n\n## Course Review So Far: A Quick Recap\n\nLet's quickly review the main ideas of causal inference we've covered.\n\n### The Big Question: Does A cause Y?\n\nCausal inference helps us answer if something (like a teaching method, $A$) causes a change in something else (like test scores, $Y$).\n\n### Core Idea: \"What If?\" (Counterfactuals)\n\nWe compare what actually happened to what *would have happened* in a different scenario.\n\n- $Y(1)$: Score if the student *had* received the new method.\n- $Y(0)$: Score if the student *had* received the old method.\n\nThe **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** = $\\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)]$ is the average difference across the whole group.\n\n### This Lecture Clarified Concepts of Interaction vs. Effect Modification vs. Individual Predictions\n\n#### Interaction (Think: Teamwork Effects)\n\n- **About:** Combining *two different interventions* (A and B).\n- **Question:** Does using both A and B together give a result different from just adding up their separate effects? (e.g., new teaching method + tutoring).\n- **Needs:** Analyse effects of A alone, B alone, and A+B together. Control confounders for *both* A and B.\n\n#### Effect Modification (Think: Different Effects for Different Groups)\n\n- **About:** How the effect of *one intervention* (A) changes based on people's *characteristics* (X, like prior grades).\n- **Question:** Does the teaching method (A) work better for high-achieving students (X=high) than low-achieving students (X=low)?\n    - **HTE:** The *idea* that effects differ.\n    - **CATE $\\tau(x)$:** The *average effect* for the specific group with characteristics $X=x$.\n- **Needs:** Analyse effect of A *within* different groups (levels of X). Control confounders for A.\n\n#### Estimated Individualised Effects ($\\hat{\\tau}(X_i)$) (Think: Personal Profile Prediction)\n\n- **About:** Using a person's *whole profile* of characteristics ($X_i$ - age, gender, background, etc.) to predict their likely response to treatment A.\n- **How:** Modern methods (like causal forests) take all of $X_i$ and estimate $\\hat{\\tau}(X_i)$.\n- **Result:** this $\\hat{\\tau}(X_i)$ is **not** the true unknowable effect for person $i$. It is the estimated *average effect for people similar to person i* (sharing characteristics $X_i$).\n- **Use:** helps explore if tailoring treatment based on these profiles ($X_i$) could be beneficial.\n\n### Simple Summary:\n\n- **Interaction:** Do A and B work together well/badly?\n- **Effect Modification:** Does A's effect depend on *who* you are (based on X)?\n- **$\\hat{\\tau}(X_i)$:** Can we *predict* A's average effect for someone based on their specific profile $X_i$?\n\nUnderstanding these differences is key to doing good causal research!\n\n## Appendix: Simplification of Additive Interaction Formula\n\nWe start with the definition of additive interaction based on comparing the joint effect relative to baseline versus the sum of individual effects relative to baseline:\n\n$$\n\\Big(\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]\\Big) - \\Big[\\Big(\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,0)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]\\Big) + \\Big(\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]\\Big)\\Big]\n$$\n\nFirst, distribute the negative sign across the terms within the square brackets:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)] - \\Big(\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,0)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]\\Big) - \\Big(\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]\\Big)\n$$\n\nNow remove the parentheses, flipping the signs inside them where preceded by a minus sign:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(1,0)] + \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,1)] + \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]\n$$\n\nNext, combine the $\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]$ terms:\n\n* We have $-\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]$\n* Then $+\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]$ (these two cancel each other out)\n* And another $+\\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]$ remains.\n\nThe expression simplifies to:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y(1,1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(1,0)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,1)] + \\mathbb{E}[Y(0,0)]\n$$\n\nThis is the standard definition of additive interaction, often called the interaction contrast. If this expression equals zero, there is no additive interaction; a non-zero value indicates an interaction effect.\n\n**This shows clearly that interaction is measured as the deviation of the joint effect from the sum of the separate effects, adjusted for the baseline.**\n",
