Visit the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/).\n2. Select the version of R suitable for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).\n3. Download and install it by following the on-screen instructions.\n\n## Installing RStudio\n\nAfter downloading R...\n\n\nSee [Johannes Karl's Video](#section-johannes)\n\n\n\n### Step 1: Install R-Studio\n\nIf you have already downloaded and installed R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN):\n\n1. Go to the RStudio download page at [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)\n2. Choose the free version of RStudio Desktop, and download it for your operating system.\n3. Download and install RStudio Desktop.\n4. Open RStudio to begin setting up your project environment.\n\n\n### Step 2: Create a new project\n\n1. In RStudio, go to `File > New Project`.\n2. Choose `New Directory` for a new project or `Existing Directory` if you have a folder where you want to initialise an RStudio project.\n3. For a new project, select `New Project`, then provide a directory name. This name will also be the name of your project.\n4. Specify the location where the project folder will be created.\n5. Click `Create Project`.\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Order your R-studio/R workflow\n\n- Clear folder structure\n- If you are using GitHub (or similar) create a location on your machine (i.d. *not* dropbox)\n- If you are not using GitHub choose the cloud (Dropbox or similar).\n- When creating new files and scripts, use clear labels that anyone could understand. \n- That \"anyone\" will be your future self, trying to make sense.\n:::\n\n\n\n### Step 3: Give project structure\n\n1. **Organising Files and Folders:**\n   - Within your project, create folders to organise your scripts and data. \n   - Common folder names include `R/` for R scripts, `data/` for datasets, and `doc/` for documentation.\n   - You can create these folders using RStudio's `Files` pane or through your operating system's file explorer.\n\n2. **Creating and Managing R Scripts:**\n   - To create a new R script, go to `File > New File > R Script`.\n   - Save the script in your project directory's `R/` folder to keep your work organised. Use meaningful file names that describe the script's purpose.\n\n3. **Version Control:**\n   - If you are familiar with version control, you can initialise a Git repository within your project by selecting the `Version Control` option when creating a new project.\n   - This allows for better tracking of changes and collaboration if working with others.\n   - If you are not familiar with version control (or have not installed `git` on your machine), do not worry about initialising a Git repository.\n\n### Step 4: Working with R-scripts\n\n1. **Writing and executing Code:**\n   - Write your R code in the *script editor.* \n   - Execute code by selecting lines and pressing `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Enter` (Mac).\n\n2. **Commenting and documentation:**\n   - Use comments (preceded by `#`) to document your code for clarity and future reference.\n\n3. **Saving and organising scripts:**\n   - Regularly save your scripts (`Ctrl + S` or `Cmd + S`).\n   - Organise scripts into folders within your project for different analyses or data processing tasks.\n\n\n### Step 5: When you exit R-studio\n\n- Before concluding your work, save your workspace or clear it to start fresh in the next session (`Session > Restart R`).\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Order your R-studio/R workflow\n- Again, use clearly defined script names\n- Annotate your code\n- Save your scripts often (`Ctrl + S` or `Cmd + S`).\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### Exercise 1: Install the `tidyverse` package\n\nFollow these instructions to install the `tidyverse` package in RStudio:\n\n1. **Open RStudio:** launch RStudio on your computer.\n\n2. **Access package installation:**\n   - Navigate to the menu at the top of RStudio and click on `Tools > Install Packages...`. This opens the Install Packages dialogue box.\n\n3. **Install `tidyverse`:**\n   - In the Install Packages dialogue box, you will see a field labelled \"Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):\". Click in this field and type `tidyverse`.\n   - Below the packages field, ensure the checkbox for `Install dependencies` is checked. This ensures all packages that `tidyverse` depends on are also installed.\n\n4. **Begin installation:**\n    - Click on the `Install` button to start the installation process.\n\nThe installation might take a few minutes. Monitor the progress in the \"Console\" pane. Once the installation is complete, you will see a message in the console indicating that the process has finished.\n\n6. **Load `tidyverse`:** After successful installation, you can load the `tidyverse` package into your R session by typing `library(tidyverse)` in the console and pressing `Enter`.\n:::\n\n\n## Basic R Commands\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### How to copy the code on this page\n\n- `R Script > New File > R`\n- Name your new R script and save it in a folder. \n- Hover your cursor over the top right of the code panel, and click the copy tab.\n- Copy the text into your script.\n- Save: `Ctrl + S` or `Cmd + S`.\n:::\n\n### Assignment (`<-`)\n\nAssignment in R is done using the '<-' operator, which on my machine renders `<-`. \nThis operator assigns values to variables:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 10 # assigns the value 10 to x\ny <- 5 # assigns the value 5 to y\n\n# this does the same\nx <- 10\ny <- 5\n\n# note what happens when we do this\n# 10 = 5 # not run\n\n# but we can do this\n# 10 == 5 # considered below\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### RStudio Assignment Operator Shortcut\n\n- **For macOS**: `Option` + `-` (minus key) inserts `<-`.\n- **For Windows and Linux**: `Alt` + `-` (minus key) inserts `<-`.\n\nConsult the latest RStudio documentation or access the Keyboard Shortcuts Help (`Tools` -> `Keyboard Shortcuts Help`) for up-to-date shortcuts.\n:::\n\n\n### Concatenation (`c()`)\n\nThe `c()` function combines multiple elements into a vector.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # a vector of numbers\nprint(numbers)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n### Operations (`+`, `-`)\n\nBasic arithmetic operations include addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`).\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# this does the same\nx <- 10\ny <- 5\n\nsum <- x + y # adds x and y\n\nprint(sum)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 15\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndifference <- x - y # subtracts y from x\n\n# note we did not need to use the `print()` function\ndifference\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n### Executing code\n-  `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Enter` (Mac).\n:::\n\nIn addition to assignment, multiplication and division are fundamental arithmetic operations in R that allow you to manipulate numeric data. Here is how you can incorporate these operations into your basic R commands documentation:\n\n### Multiplication (`*`) and Division (`/`)\n\nMultiplication and division in R are performed using the `*` and `/` operators, respectively. These operators allow for element-wise operations on vectors, as well as operations on individual numeric values.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# multiplication\nproduct <- x * y # multiplies x by y\nproduct\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 50\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# division\nquotient <- x / y # divides x by y\nquotient\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# element-wise multiplication on vectors\nvector1 <- c(1, 2, 3)\nvector2 <- c(4, 5, 6)\n# multiplies each element of vector1 by the corresponding element of vector2\nvector_product <- vector1 * vector2\nvector_product\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]  4 10 18\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# element-wise division on vectors\n# divides each element of vector1 by the corresponding element of vector2\nvector_division <- vector1 / vector2\nvector_division\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.25 0.40 0.50\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n- Multiplication and division can be used for scalar (single values) and vector (multiple values) operations. When applied to vectors, these operations are performed element-wise.\n- Be mindful of division by zero, as this will result in `Inf` (infinity) or `NaN` (not a number) depending on the context.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# example of division by zero\nresult <- 10 / 0 # results in Inf\nzero_division <- 0 / 0 # results in NaN\n```\n:::\n\n- R also supports integer division using the `%/%` operator and modulo operation using `%%` to find the remainder.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# integer division\ninteger_division <- 10 %/% 3 # results in 3\n\n# modulo operation\nremainder <- 10 %% 3 # results in 1\n```\n:::\n\n### `rm()` Remove Object\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# `rm()` remove object ----------------------------------------------------\ndevil_number <- 666 # results in 1\n\n# view\ndevil_number\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 666\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# remove the devil number\nrm(devil_number)\n\n# check\n# devil_number\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Logic (`!`, `!=`, `==`)\n\nLogical operations include NOT (`!`), NOT EQUAL (`!=`), and EQUAL (`==`).\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx_not_y <- x != y # checks if x is not equal to y\nx_not_y\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx_equal_10 <- x == 10 # checks if x is equal to 10\nx_equal_10\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nLogical operations are fundamental in R for controlling the flow of execution and making decisions based on conditions. In addition to NOT (`!`), NOT EQUAL (`!=`), and EQUAL (`==`), there are several other logical operators you should know:\n\n### OR (`|` and `||`)\n\n- The `|` operator performs element-wise logical OR operation.

R supports several fundamental data types, including integers, characters, factors, and ordered factors. Each type has its specific use case and functions associated with it.\n\n### Integers\n\nIntegers are whole numbers without decimal points. In R, integers can be explicitly defined by adding an `L` suffix to the number.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# define an integer\nx <- 42L\n\nx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 42\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# check\nstr(x) # is integer\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n int 42\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# convert to numeric\ny <- as.numeric(x)\n\nstr(y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n num 42\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nIntegers are particularly useful when dealing with counts or indices that do not require fractional values.\n\n### Characters\n\nCharacter data types are used to represent text. In R, text strings are enclosed in quotes, either single (`'`) or double (`\"`).\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# define a character string\nname <- \"Alice\"\n```\n:::\n\nCharacters are essential for categorical data that does not fit into numerical categories, such as names, labels, and descriptions.\n\n### Factors\n\nFactors are used to represent categorical data that can take on a limited number of values, known as levels. Factors are useful for statistical modeling as they explicitly define categories in the data.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Define a factor\ncolors <- factor(c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"))\n```\n:::\n\nFactors can improve efficiency and memory usage when dealing with categorical data, especially in large datasets. And they are useful when dealing with categorical variables (naturally).\n\n#### Ordered Factors\n\nOrdered factors are a special type of factor where the levels have an inherent order.

It is used to combine data frames or matrices by rows. This function is particularly useful when you want to add new observations or records to an existing data frame.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#  adding a new row\nnew_person <- data.frame(name = \"eve\", age = 32, gender = \"female\")\ndf <- rbind(df, new_person)\n\n# verify the row addition\nhead(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     name age gender\n1   alice  25 female\n2     bob  30   male\n3 charlie  35   male\n4     eve  32 female\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nWhen using `rbind()`, ensure that the columns in the data frames being combined match in both name and order. If they do not match, you may encounter errors or unexpected results.\n\n### Adding Columns with `cbind()`\n\nConversely, the `cbind()` function in R stands for \"column bind\". It is used to combine data frames or matrices by columns. This function allows you to add new variables to an existing data frame.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# example of adding a new column\ndf$occupation <- c(\"engineer\", \"doctor\", \"artist\", \"doctor\") # direct assignment\n\n# or using cbind for a separate vector\noccupation_vector <- c(\"engineer\", \"doctor\", \"artist\", \"doctor\")\ndf <- cbind(df, occupation_vector)\n\n# verify the column addition\nhead(df)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     name age gender occupation occupation_vector\n1   alice  25 female   engineer          engineer\n2     bob  30   male     doctor            doctor\n3 charlie  35   male     artist            artist\n4     eve  32 female     doctor            doctor\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs with `rbind()`, when using `cbind()`, it is crucial that the data frames or vectors being combined have compatible dimensions. For `cbind()`, the number of rows must match.\n\n### Considerations for `rbind()` and `cbind()`\n\nWhile `rbind()` and `cbind()` are straightforward and powerful functions for combining data, they have some limitations:\n\n- **Matching Column or Row Names**: for `rbind()`, the column names between the data frames need to match exactly. For `cbind()`, the row numbers must be equal.\n- **Factor Levels**: when binding factors with different levels, R will unify the levels, which can sometimes lead to unexpected results. Be mindful of factor levels when using these functions.\n- **Performance**: we will use a different approach next week (and following), draing on the`dplyr` package, which will connect more easily to our workflows. \n\nBy understanding and utilizing `rbind()` and `cbind()`, you can efficiently manipulate the structure of your data frames, adding flexibility to your data analysis workflows in R.\n\n\n\n### View Data Structure (`summary()`, `str()`, `head()`, `tail()`)\n\n- `summary()`: Provides a summary of an object's structure.\n- `str()`: Displays the structure of an object.\n- `head()`: Shows the first few rows of a data frame or the first elements of a vector.\n- `tail()`: Shows the last few rows of a data frame or the last elements of a vector.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# iris is a preloaded dataset\nstr(iris) # displays structure of scores_df\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n'data.frame':\t150 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...\n $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...\n $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...\n $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...\n $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"setosa\",\"versicolor\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(iris) # summary statistics\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width   \n Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100  \n 1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300  \n Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300  \n Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199  \n 3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800  \n Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500  \n       Species  \n setosa    :50  \n versicolor:50  \n virginica :50  \n                \n                \n                \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(iris) # first few rows\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntail(iris) # last few rows\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width   Species\n145          6.7         3.3          5.7         2.5 virginica\n146          6.7         3.0          5.2         2.3 virginica\n147          6.3         2.5          5.0         1.9 virginica\n148          6.5         3.0          5.2         2.0 virginica\n149          6.2         3.4          5.4         2.3 virginica\n150          5.9         3.0          5.1         1.8 virginica\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n### mean()\n\n- Calculates the arithmetic mean of a numerical object.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(12345)\n\n# we will cover R’s powerful simulation functions like `rnorm()`next week\nvector <- rnorm(n = 40, mean = 0, sd = 1)\nmean(vector) # note the sampling error here\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.2401853\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n### sd()\n\n- Computes the standard deviation, which measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd(vector) # replace 'vector' with your numerical vector\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1.038425\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n### min() and max()\n\n- These functions return a numerical object's minimum and maximum values, respectively.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmin(vector) # minimum value\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] -1.817956\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmax(vector) # maximum value\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.196834\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n### table()\n\n- Generates a frequency table of an object, useful for categorical data.

It is based on the Grammar of Graphics, allowing users to build plots layer by layer, making it versatile for creating a wide range of plots.\n\n#### Installing and Loading `ggplot2`\n\nBefore using `ggplot2`, ensure the package is installed and loaded into your R session:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load ggplot2\nif (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(12345)\n\n# simulate student data (more on simulation next week)\nstudent_data <- data.frame(\n    name = c(\"alice\", \"bob\", \"charlie\", \"diana\", \"ethan\", \"fiona\", \"george\", \"hannah\"),\n    score = sample(80:100, 8, replace = TRUE), # random scores between 80 and 100\n    stringsasfactors = FALSE\n)\n\n# determine pass/fail based on score\n# we will cover the ifelse() operator in detail in upcoming weeks\nstudent_data$passed <- ifelse(student_data$score >= 90, \"passed\", \"failed\")\n\n# convert 'passed' to factor for colour coding in ggplot2\nstudent_data$passed <- factor(student_data$passed, levels = c(\"failed\", \"passed\"))\n\n# view the first few rows of the data frame\nhead(student_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     name score stringsasfactors passed\n1   alice    93            FALSE passed\n2     bob    98            FALSE passed\n3 charlie    95            FALSE passed\n4   diana    90            FALSE passed\n5   ethan    81            FALSE failed\n6   fiona    90            FALSE passed\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# simulate study hours\nstudent_data$study_hours <- sample(5:15, 8, replace = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Basic Components of a `ggplot2` Plot\n\n- **Data:** the dataset you want to visualise.\n- **Aesthetics (`aes`):** defines how data are mapped to colour, size, shape, and other visual properties.\n- **Geometries (`geom_` functions):** the type of plot or layer you want to add (e.g., points, lines, bars).\n\n#### Create a Basic Plot\n\nStart by creating a simple bar plot:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(student_data, aes(x = name, y = score)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThis code plots `score` for each `name` in the `student_data` dataframe. The `stat = \"identity\"` argument tells `ggplot2` to use the `score` values directly to determine the height of the bars.\n\n#### Customising the plot\n\nTo enhance your plot, you can add titles, change axis labels, and modify colours:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(student_data, aes(x = name, y = score, fill = passed)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"true\" = \"blue\", \"FALSE\" = \"red\")) +\n    labs(title = \"student scores\", x = \"student name\", y = \"score\") +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n- `aes(fill = passed)`: maps the `passed` variable to the colour fill of the bars, allowing for colour differentiation based on whether students passed or failed.\n- `scale_fill_manual()`: customizes the colours used for the `true` and `FALSE` values of the `passed` variable.\n- `labs()`: adds a main title and axis labels.\n- `theme_minimal()`: applies a minimalistic theme to the plot for a cleaner appearance.\n\n\n### Scatter Plot with `ggplot2`\n\nA scatter plot is useful for examining the relationship between two continuous variables. \n\nWe next simulate a scenario where we compare student scores against study hours.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create scatter plot\nggplot(student_data, aes(x = study_hours, y = score, color = passed)) +\n    geom_point(size = 4) +\n    labs(title = \"student scores vs. study hours\", x = \"study hours\", y = \"score\") +\n

R Graphs\n\nAlthough `ggplot2` is renowned for its flexibility and aesthetic appeal, Base R graphics remain a staple for straightforward and quick visualisations. \n\nBase R provides a set of plotting functions that are readily available without the need for additional packages, and it is speedy.\n\n\n### Basic Plotting Functions\n\n- `plot()`: the workhorse of Base R for creating scatter plots, line graphs, and more, with extensive customisation options.\n- `hist()`: generates histograms to explore the distribution of a single continuous variable.\n- `boxplot()`: useful for comparing distributions across groups, showing medians, quartiles, and outliers.\n- `barplot()`: Creates bar graphs for visualising categorical data.\n\n### Creating a Basic Scatter Plot with Base R\n\nConsider simple scatter plot using the data we have just simulated\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# basic scatter plot with Base R\nplot(student_data$study_hours, student_data$score,\n    main = \"Scatter Plot of Scores vs. Study Hours\",\n    xlab = \"Study Hours\", ylab = \"Score\",\n    pch = 19, col = ifelse(student_data$passed == \"passed\", \"blue\", \"red\")\n)\n```\n\n:::

scores on the y-axis. The `pch` parameter specifies the symbol type, and `col` changes the colour based on whether the student passed or failed.\n\n### Generating a Histogram with Base R\n\nTo visualise the distribution of student scores:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# histogram with Base R\nhist(student_data$score,\n    breaks = 5,\n    col = \"skyblue\",\n    main = \"Histogram of Student Scores\",\n    xlab = \"Scores\",\n    border = \"white\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-51-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThis histogram provides a quick overview of the scores' distribution, using the `hist` function with specified `breaks`, `col` for colour, and `border` for the colour of the histogram borders.\n\n### Generate Line Plot with Base R\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# must be numeric\nmonths_num <- 1:length(study_data$month) # Simple numeric sequence\n\n# plot points with suppressed x-axis\nplot(months_num, study_data$study_hours,\n    type = \"p\", # Points\n    pch = 19, # Type of point\n    col = \"red\",\n    xlab = \"Month\",\n    ylab = \"Study Hours\",\n    main = \"Monthly Study Hours\",\n    xaxt = \"n\"\n) # Suppress the x-axis\n\n# add lines between points\nlines(months_num, study_data$study_hours,\n    col = \"blue\",\n    lwd = 1\n) # Line width\n\n# add custom month labels to the x-axis at appropriate positions\naxis(1, at = months_num, labels = study_data$month, las = 2) # `las=2` makes labels perpendicular to axis\n\n# Optional: adding a box around the plot for a minimalistic look\nbox()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-52-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Comparing Distributions with Box Plots\n\nBox plots in Base R can compare the score distributions across the pass/fail status:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Box plot with Base R\nboxplot(score ~ passed,\n    data = student_data,\n    main = \"Score Distribution by Pass/Fail Status\",\n    xlab = \"Status\", ylab = \"Scores\",\n    col = c(\"red\", \"blue\")\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-53-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThis code uses the `boxplot` function to create box plots for scores, grouped by the pass/fail status, with custom colours for each group.\n\n## Summary of Today's Lab\n\nCongratulations on completing Lab 1! \n\nThis session has laid the groundwork. We have covered a lot, but we'll have a good deal of practice throughout the course to reinforce the learning. \n\n### What We Have Learned\n\n- **How to install and setup R:** \n\nYou've successfully installed R and RStudio, setting up your workstation for statistical analysis.\n  \n- **How to install and use R-Studio:** \n\nYou've familiarised yourself with the RStudio interface, including the console, source editor, environment tab, and other utilities for effective data analysis.\n  \n- **Basic R operations:** \n\nYou've practided using R for basic arithmetic operations, understanding how to execute simple commands in the console.\n  \n- **Basic R Data Structures such as:** \n\n  - **Vectors and Matrices:** You have learned to create and manipulate vectors and matrices, the simplest forms of data storage in R, which are crucial for handling numeric, character, and logical data types in a structured manner.\n\n  - **Data Frames:** You've been introduced to data frames, a key data structure in R for storing tabular data. Data frames accommodate columns of different data types, making them highly versatile for data analysis and manipulation.\n\n  - **Factors and Ordered Factors:** Understanding factors and ordered factors has provided you with the tools to handle categorical data effectively, including the ability to manage and analyse data involving categorical variables with both unordered and ordered levels.\n\n- **Basics of `ggplot2`:**\n\nYou've been equipped with the fundamentals of data visualisation using `ggplot2`, including how to create basic plots like bar charts, scatter plots, and line graphs. You've learned about the importance of aesthetics (`aes`) and geometries (`geom_` functions) in creating visually appealing and informative graphics.\n\n- **Customizing Plots:** \n\nTechniques for enhancing plots with titles, axis labels, and custom colour schemes have been covered. You've practised making your visualisations more informative and engaging by customising plot aesthetics.\n\n\n### How to Build Skills?\n\n- **Practical Application:** \n\nDo the hands-on exercises at home. They'll help you apply what you have learned here.\n\n\n\n### Where to Get Help\n\nAs sure as night follows day, you will need help coding. Good resources:\n\n1. **Large Language Models (LLMs):** LLMs are trained on extensive datasets. They are extremely good coding tutors. Open AI's GPT-4 considerably outperforms GPT-3.5.  However GPT 3.5 should be good enough. Gemini has a two-month free trial. LLM's are rapidly evolving. However, presently, to use these tools, and to spot their errors, you will need to know how to code.  Which is fortunate because coding makes you smarter!\n\n**Note:** you will not be assessed for R-code. Help from LLM's for *coding* does not consitute a breach of academic integrity in this course. Your tests are in-class; no LLM's allowed.  For your final report, you will need to cite all sources, and how you used them, including LLMs. \n\n2. [**Stack Overflow:**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): an outstanding resource for most problems. Great community. \n\n3. [Cross-validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/) the best place to go for stats advice. (LLM's are only safe for standard statistics. They do not perform well for causal inference.)\n\n4. **Developer Websites and GitHub Pages:** [Tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse)\n\n4.  Your tutors and course coordinator. We care.

This opens the Install Packages dialogue box.\n\n3. **Install `tidyverse`:**\n   - In the Install Packages dialogue box, you will see a field labelled \"Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):\". Click in this field and type `tidyverse`.\n   - Below the packages field, ensure the checkbox for `Install dependencies` is checked. This ensures all packages that `tidyverse` depends on are also installed.\n\n4. **Begin installation:**\n    - Click on the `Install` button to start the installation process.\n\nThe installation might take a few minutes. Monitor the progress in the \"Console\" pane. Once the installation is complete, you will see a message in the console indicating that the process has finished.\n\n6. **Load `tidyverse`:** After successful installation, you can load the `tidyverse` package into your R session by typing `library(tidyverse)` in the console and pressing `Enter`.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n### Exercise 2: Install the `parameters` and `report` packages\n\nTo install the `parameters` and `report` packages in RStudio, follow these instructions:\n\n1. **Open RStudio:** start by launching the RStudio application on your computer.\n\n2. **Access Package Installation:**\n   - Go to the RStudio menu bar at the top of the screen and click on `Tools > Install Packages...`. This action opens the Install Packages dialogue box.\n\n3. **Install `parameters` and `report`:**\n   - In the Install Packages dialogue box, locate the field labelled \"Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):\". Click in this field and type `parameters, report`, separating the package names with a comma.\n   - Make sure the checkbox for `Install dependencies` is selected. This ensures that any additional packages needed by `parameters` and `report` are also installed.\n   - Click the `Install` button to initiate the installation of both packages and their dependencies.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### Exercise 3: Basic Operations and Data Structure Manipulation\n\n**Objective:** Practice creating vectors and performing basic arithmetic operations.\n\n1. Create two numeric vectors, `vector_a` and `vector_b`, with the following values:\n   - `vector_a`: 2, 4, 6, 8\n   - `vector_b`: 1, 3, 5, 7\n\n2. Perform the following operations and store the results in new variables:\n   - Add `vector_a` and `vector_b`.\n   - Subtract `vector_b` from `vector_a`.\n   - Multiply `vector_a` by 2.\n   - Divide `vector_b` by 2.\n\n3. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of both `vector_a` and `vector_b`.\n::: \n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### Exercise 4: Working with Data Frames\n\n**Objective:** Gain familiarity with data frame creation, manipulation, and basic data exploration functions.\n\n1. Create a data frame `student_data` with the following columns:\n   - `id`: 1, 2, 3, 4\n   - `name`: alice, bob, charlie, diana\n   - `score`: 88, 92, 85, 95\n   - Ensure you set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`.\n\n2. Add a new column `passed` to `student_data` indicating whether the student passed. Assume a pass mark of 90.\n\n3. Extract the `name` and `score` of students who passed into a new data frame.\n\n4. Use `summary()`, `head()`, and `str()` functions to explore `student_data`.\n::: \n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### Exercise 5 Logical Operations and Subsetting\n\n**Objective:** Practice using logical operations to subset data frames.\n\n1. Using the `student_data` data frame from Exercise 2, subset the data to find students who scored above the mean score of the class.\n\n2. Create a vector `attendance` with values (`present`, `absent`, `present`, `present`) corresponding to each student's attendance.\n\n3. Add `attendance` as a new column to `student_data` and then subset the data frame to select only the rows where students were present.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### Exercise 6: Cross-Tabulation and Analysis\n\n**Objective:** Understand the use of `table()` function for cross-tabulation and analysis.\n\n1. Create two-factor variables:\n   - `fruit`: apple, banana, apple, orange, banana\n   - `colour`: red, yellow, green, orange, green\n\n2. Convert `fruit` and `colour` into factors and then into a data frame named `fruit_data`.\n\n3. Use the `table()` function to perform a cross-tabulation of `fruit` by `colour`.\n\n4. Interpret the results. Which fruit has the most colour variety?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### Exercise 7: Visualization with `ggplot2`\n\n**Objective:** (If `ggplot2` was introduced) Create a simple plot to visualise the data.\n\n1. Install and load the `ggplot2` package if not already done.\n\n2. Using `student_data`, create a bar plot showing the scores of students. Use `name` for the x-axis and `score` for the y-axis.\n\n3. Enhance the plot by adding a title, x and y-axis labels, and use different colours for passed and failed students.\n\nThese exercises are designed to be progressively challenging, ensuring that students apply what they've learned about basic operations, data frame manipulation, logical operations, and simple data analysis and visualisation in R.\n:::\n\n\n## Appendix B: Solutions\n\n### Solutions 1 and 2\n\n- Exercises 1 and 2 have no solutions.

lists\n\nTo create a list, you use the `list()` function. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Creating a simple list\nmy_list <- list(name = \"John Doe\", age = 30, scores = c(90, 80, 70))\n\n# A list containing various types of elements, including another list\ncomplex_list <- list(id = 1, name = \"Jane Doe\", preferences = list(color = \"blue\", hobby = \"reading\"))\n```\n:::\n\n#### Accessing list elements\n\nList elements can be accessed using the `[[ ]]` notation for single elements, or the `$` notation if you're accessing named elements:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Accessing elements\nname <- my_list$name # or my_list[[\"name\"]]\n\npreference_color <- complex_list$preferences$color\n```\n:::\n\n#### Modifying lists\n\nLists can be modified by adding new elements, changing existing elements, or removing elements:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Adding a new element\nmy_list$gender <- \"Male\"\n\n# Changing an existing element\nmy_list$age <- 31\n\n# Removing an element\nmy_list$scores <- NULL\n```\n:::\n\n#### Lists in Functions\n\nLists are often used as return values for functions that need to provide multiple pieces of data:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Function returning a list\ncalculate_stats <- function(numbers) {\n    mean_val <- mean(numbers)\n    sum_val <- sum(numbers)\n    return(list(mean = mean_val, sum = sum_val))\n}\n\n# Using the function\nresults <- calculate_stats(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n",
