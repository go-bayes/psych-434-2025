#### Tyler VanderWeele on Measurement Contructs 

- Abstract. Psychosocial constructs can only be assessed indirectly, and measures are typically formed by a combination of indicators that are thought to relate to the construct. Reflective and formative measurement models offer different conceptualizations of the relation between the indicators and what is sometimes conceived of as a univariate latent variable supposedly corresponding to the construct. I argue that the empirical implications of these models will often be violated by data since the causally relevant constituents will generally be multivariate, not univariate. In fact, the assumption of an underlying univariate structural latent variable is so strong that it has empirically testable implications, even though the latent is unobserved. Formal statistical tests can be developed to reject this assumption, but factor analysis, as typically practiced, is not adequate to do so. Factor analysis also suffers from the inability to distinguish associations arising from causal versus conceptual relations. I put forward an outline for a new model of the process of measure construction and propose a causal interpretation of associations between constructed measures and subsequent outcomes that is applicable even if the usual assumptions of reflective and formative models fail. I discuss the practical implications of these observations and proposals for the provision of definitions, the selection of items, item-by-item analyses, the construction of measures, and the causal interpretation of regression analyses.

####  Stijn Vansteelandt and Besty Ogburn on Causal Inference (Workflows)

 > Abstract: Causal inference research has shifted from being primarily descriptive (describing the data-generating mechanism using statistical models) to being primarily prescriptive (evaluating the effects of specific interventions). The focus has thereby moved from being centered on statistical models to being centered on causal estimands. This evolution has been driven by the increasing need for practical solutions to real-world problems, such as designing effective interventions, making policy decisions, and identifying effective treatment strategies. It has brought enormous progress, not solely in terms of delivering more useful answers to the scientific questions at stake, but also in providing a more hygienic inference that targets a well-understood causal estimand. However, many causal questions are not readily translated into the effects of specific interventions, and even if they can, scientists may be reliant on help from an expert statistician to make that translation, may not find the considered interventions feasible or of immediate interest, or may find too little information in the data about the considered estimand. In this talk, I will reflect on this and argue that hygienic causal inference thinking therefore comes with a price. I will next propose a compromise solution at the intersection of descriptive and prescriptive causal inference. It borrows the flexibility of statistical modeling, while tying model parameters to causal estimands in order to ensure that we understand what is being estimated and obtain valid (data-adaptive) inference for it, even when the model is wrong. Examples on structural (nested) mean models, instrumental variables estimation, target trials, ‚Ä¶ will be used to provide insight.
