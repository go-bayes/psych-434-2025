## 0Where does psychology start?


::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
Psychology starts with a question about how people think or behave.
:::


## Group discussion {.incremental}

- We know that bilingual children tend to perform better on various cognitive tasks. Why might this be the case? 

- How can we know whether it is bilingualism that causes better performance on various cognitive tasks? 


## Hume's definitions of a causality 


> “we may define a cause to be an object followed by another, and where all the objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second [definition 1]. Or, in other words, **where, if the first object had not been, the second never would have existed** [definition 2].” - David Hume, Enquiries Concerning Human Understanding, and Concerning the Principles of Morals, Section VII


## Individual causal effects

$Y_i^{a = 1}$: The cognitive ability of child $i$ if they were bilingual.  This is the counterfactual outcome when A = 1.

$Y_i^{a = 0}$: The cognitive ability of child $i$ if they were monolingual. This is the counterfactual outcome when A = 0.

$$
\text{Causal Effect}_i = Y^{a = 1} - Y^{a = 0} 
$$

##  Individual causal quantities

We say there is a causal effect for individual $i$ if: 

$$
Y_i^{a=1} - Y_i^{a=0}  \neq 0
$$

## What is the problem? 

- These data required to compute this quantity is generally not available.


## Two Roads Diverge in a Yellow Wood

Robert Frost writes, 

>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

>And sorry I could not travel both

>And be one traveler, long I stood

>And looked down one as far as I could

>To where it bent in the undergrowth;



>Then took the other, as just as fair,

>And having perhaps the better claim,

>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

>Though as for that the passing there

>Had worn them really about the same,


>And both that morning equally lay

>In leaves no step had trodden black.

>Oh, I kept the first for another day!

>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,


>I doubted if I should ever come back.

>I shall be telling this with a sigh

>Somewhere ages and ages hence:

>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—

>I took the one less traveled by,

>And that has made all the difference. 

> Robert Frost, The Road Not Taken

## How can we identify causal effects? {.incremental}

-   Recall the answers you proposed to bilingual causal question

    -   e.g. experiment: random assigment to bilingual training.

-   How does this work?

    -  Confounders equally distributed
    -  Count up results
    -  Take the average of the differences in the two groups.
    

## Average Treatement Effect in a Randomised Experiment


\begin{align}
E(\delta) = E(Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0})\\
          ~  = E(Y^{a=1}) - E(Y^{a=0}) \\
          ~  = ATE
\end{align} 

:::{.notes}
- E($\delta$) is the "estimand" or causal quantity of interest (the expected difference between the means of two randomised groups, or equivalentally, the mean of the differences)

## Assumptions Required for Estimating Causal Effects From Data

- Causal Consistency: The values of exposure under comparisons correspond to well-defined interventions that, in turn, correspond to the versions of treatment in the data.(see: Chatton, Hernan & Robbins)
- Positivity:  The probability of receiving every value of the exposure within all strata of co-variates is greater than zero 
- Exchangeablility:The conditional probability of receiving every value of an exposure level, though not decided by the investigators, depends only on the measured covariates (see: Chatton, Hernan & Robbins)


## Causal Consistency assumption 


::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
The values of exposure under comparisons correspond to well-defined interventions that, in turn, correspond to the versions of treatment in the data.
:::

\begin{equation} 
Y^{obs} = AY^{a=1} + (1-A)Y^{a=0}
\end{equation}


## Causal Consistency gets from observations to counterfactuals


For individuals with exposure level $A = 1$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(Y^{obs}|A = 1) &= 1 \times A  \times Y^{a=1} + (1-1) \times Y^{a=0}\\
& = 1 \times Y^{a=1} + 0 \times  Y^{a=0} \\
 & =  Y^{a=1}
\end{split}
\end{equation}


For individuals with exposure level $A = 0$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(Y^{obs}|A = 0) &= 0 \times A  \times Y^{a=1} + (1-0) \times Y^{a=0}\\
& = 0 \times Y^{a=1} + 1 \times  Y^{a=0} \\
 & =  Y^{a=0}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Which implies:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Y_i &= Y_i^{a=1}~~~\text{if}~ A_i = 1\\
Y_i &= Y_i^{a=0}~~~ \text{if}~  A_i = 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}


## Positivity

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
The probability of receiving every value of the exposure within all strata of co-variates is greater than zero 
:::

\begin{equation}
0 < \Pr(A=a|L)<1, ~ \forall a \in A, ~ \forall a \in L
\end{equation}

- Two types of positivity violations
  - Random non-positivity:  the casual effect of aging with observations missing at ages 40-41 (we use parametric models as a work around.)
  - Deterministic non-positivity: the causal effect of hysterectomy in biological males (assumption violated).


## Conditional Exchangeability 

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
The conditional probability of receiving every value of an exposure level, though not decided by the investigators, depends only on the measured covariates
:::

def: $\coprod$ means "independent of", $a|b$ translates to "$a$ conditional on $b$"


\begin{equation}
Y^{a=1},Y^{a=0}\coprod A|L
\end{equation}



or equivalently

\begin{equation}
A \coprod Y^{a=1},Y^{a=0}|L
\end{equation}


Where $L$ is the set of co-variates sufficient to ensure the independence of the counterfactual outcomes and the exposure.

## Average Treatement Effect in Observational Studies

Where $L$ is observed: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
ATE = E[Y^{a=1}|L = l] - E[Y^{a=0}|L = l] ~ \text{for any value}~l
\end{aligned}
$$




## Causal Graphs 

Psychology starts with a question. "Does A cause Y?"

![cg-1](Slide1.jpeg)





## Question:

![cg-2](Slide2.jpeg)

## One Problem


![cg-3](Slide3.jpeg)

## Solution: collect time-series data

![cg-4](Slide4.jpeg)


## Why time series data are critical

![cg-5](Slide5.jpeg)


## Another problem: common causes of A an Y (D-separation)


![cg-6](Slide6.jpeg)

## Solution: condition on common causes to ensure d-separation


![cg-8](Slide8.jpeg)


## Another problem: conditioning on a mediator

![cg-7](Slide7.jpeg)

## Conditioning on a mediator is a common problem

![cg-9](Slide9.jpeg)

## Forshadowing: in the weeks ahead we will discuss inferring mediated causal effects


![cg-10](Slide10.jpeg)
![cg-11](Slide11.jpeg)


## Collider bias


![cg-13](Slide13.jpeg)

## Collider bias: solution do not condition on a collider

## Conditioning on descendants

##  Clear Advice for Drawing Causal Graphs

- Ensure that causes come before effects. Assign time indices to your variables.
- Organize your variables chronologically.
- Simplify your graph by removing unnecessary nodes that don't impact the assessment of bias between an exposure and an outcome.
- Keep in mind that Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are qualitative tools. They don't represent non-linear associations or interactions. 
- Avoid depicting interactions by crossing arrows.
- Remember that DAGs are distinct from graphs used in Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Be cautious of SEM literature, as it often overlooks the assumptions needed for causal inference.


## Summary: Drawing Causal Graphs (DAGs)

- Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) help visualize sources of bias.

- There are five main sources of bias:
  1. Temporal order ambiguity: Uncertainty about whether causes precede effects. Solution: Collect time series data or clarify assumptions when unavailable.
  2. Common causes of exposure and outcome: Address this by including common causes in your statistical model (e.g., using regression).
  3. Conditioning on a mediator: Avoid this unless mediation is of interest.
  4. Conditioning on a collider: Refrain from doing this.
  5. Bias induced by conditioning on a confounder's descendant: Draw your DAG and follow guidelines for points 1-4.

- Important Note 1: In observational studies, it's impossible to guarantee complete control for confounding. Always conduct sensitivity analyses. Techniques for sensitivity analyses will be discussed next week.

- Important Note 2: Methods for computing causal effects for group comparisons will be covered in the following week's lecture.


## What have we learned? 


1.  Cause/Effect: a contrast between the world under different interventions, at most one of which is realised. 
2.  Confounding: failure to condition on a common cause.
3.  Collider bias: conditioning on a common effect

Metric equivalence: Factor loadings are similar across groups.
Configural equivalence: The factor structure is the same across groups in a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis.
Scalar equivalence: Values/Means are also equivalent across groups.
